FEMALE STUDENT

Hi, I’m a little lost. Um, is this the housing maintenance office?

MALE UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEE

You found it. How can I help you?

FEMALE STUDENT

Oh, good. I have a quick question: are we allowed to keep electric heaters in our rooms?

MALE UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEE

Actually, you’re not. What’s going on? Your room cold?

FEMALE STUDENT

It’s freezing in my room. I think the heat went out or something.

MALE UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEE

Are you sure it’s out? Maybe it just got turned down too far.

FEMALE STUDENT

Oh, no. I tried adjusting the, uh, the heat control, but it doesn’t make any difference. It’s so cold in my bedroom I can’t sleep at night. I’ve actually been sleeping on the sofa in the front room; the heat still works in there. Actually, we get hot air in all the bedrooms—except ours!

MALE UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEE

Wow. Do you have a roommate?

FEMALE STUDENT

Yeah, but she says she isn’t bothered by the cold. But on the sofa I’m kept up by the noise out in the hall—the dorms can sometimes get pretty noisy. So … what can be done about it?

MALE UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEE

Well, OK, there’s a couple of things we can do. I can have a custodian take a look at it and see if he can do something.

FEMALE STUDENT

Actually I asked the custodian yesterday to take a look, but he said he couldn’t find anything wrong. He said that some of the other rooms have lost heat also, and that if we’d come here, you guys would fix it.

MALE UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEE

Oh, he did? That’s weird because I would have… well, the custodians themselves are usually supposed to report any problems right away. OK, in that case, then what you need to do is … here, fill out this form.

FEMALE STUDENT

I have to fill out a form? 

MALE UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEE

Yeah. But at least that’ll put your heater problem in a work order for the maintenance crew and they’ll get to you as soon as possible. Just so you know, because it’s not winter yet, and it’s not as cold as it could be … it may take a few days for a maintenance crew to get to you.

FEMALE STUDENT

A few days? I can’t even sleep in my own room! Can’t we just get an electric heater?

MALE UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEE

I’m sorry, but students just aren’t allowed. OK, I can see that this is a problem, and not just with your room. So, if you can get the form back to me this afternoon, I’ll try to get a maintenance crew to look at your problem by tomorrow. How’s that?

FEMALE STUDENT

Oh, that would be great, seriously. I have to take off now, but when I fill this form out, I give it to you, right?

MALE UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEE

Right, and if I’m not here, just put it in my in box and I’ll get it.
