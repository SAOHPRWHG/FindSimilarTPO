Hi, I’m looking for this book, The American Judicial System, and I can’t seem to find it anywhere. I need to read a chapter for my political science class.

MALE EMPLOYEE

Let me check in the computer. Umm…it doesn’t seem to be checked out and it’s not on reserve. You’ve checked the shelves, I assume.

FEMALE STUDENT

Yeah, I even checked other shelves and tables next to where the book should be.

MALE EMPLOYEE

Well, it’s still here in the library, so people must be using it. Ya know, this seems to be a very popular book tonight. We show six copies, none are checked out, and yet you didn’t even find one copy on the shelves. Is it a big class?

FEMALE STUDENT

Maybe about 75?

MALE EMPLOYEE

Well, you should ask your professor to put some of the copies on reserve. You know about the reserve system, right?

FEMALE STUDENT

I know that you have to read reserve books in the library and that you have time limits. But I didn’t know that I could ask a professor to put a book on reserve. I mean, I thought the professors make that kind of decision at the beginning of the semester.

MALE EMPLOYEE

Oh, they can put books on reserve at any time during the semester.

FEMALE STUDENT

You know, reserving books seems a bit unfair. What if someone who’s not in the class wants to use the book?

MALE EMPLOYEE

That’s why I said some copies. 

FEMALE STUDENT

Ahh. Well, I’ll certainly talk to my professor about it tomorrow, but what am I gonna do tonight?

MALE EMPLOYEE

I guess you could walk around the poli-sci section and look at the books waiting to be reshelved.

FEMALE STUDENT

There do seem to be more than normal…

MALE EMPLOYEE

We’re a little short-staffed right now—someone quit recently—so things aren’t getting reshelved as quickly as usual. I don’t think they’ve hired a replacement yet, so yeah, the unshelved books can get a bit out of hand.

FEMALE STUDENT

This may sound a bit weird, but…I’ve been thinking about getting a job… Um, I’ve never worked in a library before but…

MALE EMPLOYEE

Well, that’s not a requirement. The job might still be open. At the beginning of the semester we were swamped with applications, but I guess everyone who wants a job has one by now.

FEMALE STUDENT

What can you tell me about the job?

MALE EMPLOYEE

Well, we work between 6 and 10 hours a week, so it’s a reasonable amount. Usually we can pick the hours we want to work ... but since you’d be starting so late in the semester, I’m not sure how that would work for you. And, uh, oh, we get paid the normal university rates for student employees. 

FEMALE STUDENT

So, who do I talk to?

MALE EMPLOYEE

I-I guess you’d talk to Dr. Jenkins, the head librarian. She does the hiring.
