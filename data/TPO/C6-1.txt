MALE STUDENT

Hi. Do you have a minute?

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

Sure. How can I help you?

MALE STUDENT

I have a couple of questions about the career fair next week.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

OK, shoot.

MALE STUDENT

Um, well, are seniors the only ones who can go? I mean, you know, they’re finishing school this year and getting their degrees and everything… and, well, it seems like businesses would want to talk to them and not first-year students like me…

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

No no. The career fair is open to all our students and we encourage anyone who’s interested to go check it out.

MALE STUDENT

Well, that’s good to know.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

You’ve seen the flyers and the posters around campus, I assume.

MALE STUDENT

Sure! Can’t miss ’em. I mean, they all say where and when the fair is… just not who should attend.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

Actually, they do. But it’s in the small print. We should probably make that part easier to read, shouldn’t we? I’ll make a note of that right now. So, do you have any other questions?

MALE STUDENT

Yes, actually I do now. Um, since I’d only be going to familiarize myself with the process— you know, “check it out”— I was wondering if there’s anything you’d recommend that I do to prepare.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

That’s actually a very good question. As you know, the career fair is generally an opportunity for local businesses to recruit new employees and for soon-to-be graduates to have interviews with several companies they might be interested in working for. Now, in your case, even though you wouldn’t be looking for employment right now, it still wouldn’t hurt for you to prepare much like you would if you were looking for a job.

MALE STUDENT

You mean like get my resume together and wear a suit?

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

That’s a given. I was thinking more along the lines of doing some research. The flyers and posters list all the businesses that are sending representatives to the career fair. Um, what’s your major, or do you have one yet?

MALE STUDENT

Well, I haven’t declared a major yet but I’m strongly considering accounting. See, that’s part of the reason I want to go to the fair… to help me decide if that’s what I really want to study…

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

That’s very wise. Well, I suggest that you get on the computer and learn more about the accounting companies, in particular, that will be attending. You can learn a lot about companies from their Internet Web sites. Then prepare a list of questions.

MALE STUDENT

Questions… hmm.So in a way I’ll be interviewing them?

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

That’s one way of looking at it. Think about it for a second. What do you want to know about working for an accounting firm?

MALE STUDENT

Well, there’s the job itself… and salary, of course… and, um working conditions… I mean, would I have an office or would I work in a big room with a zillion other employees? And… um…and maybe about opportunities for advancement…

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

See? Those are all important things to know. After you do some research you’ll be able to tailor your questions to the particular company you’re talking to.

MALE STUDENT

Wow, I’m glad I came by here! So, it looks like I’ve got some work to do.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

And if you plan on attending future career fairs, I recommend you sign up for one of our interview workshops.

MALE STUDENT

I’ll do that.
