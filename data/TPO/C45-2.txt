MALE PROFESSOR

Excellent presentation you made at the end of class yesterday!

FEMALE STUDENT

Oh, thanks!

MALE PROFESSOR

I’m so glad you volunteered to present first. Starting out by outlining what you were going to say, then, at the end, summarizing the key points—it was a very effective way of getting your points across.

FEMALE STUDENT

I’m glad you think so. I was afraid it might come across as… too formal.

MALE PROFESSOR

Not at all. In fact, I think it’s a great approach, in general, for these presentations, so I hope the others were taking note. And the economic model you discussed—build-operate-transfer—I think everyone was quite interested.

FEMALE STUDENT

Yeah, it makes so much sense. If governments allow private companies to build public works, like a power plant, and then operate it for a decade or two before transferring ownership to the government, everyone benefits.

MALE PROFESSOR

Yes, the private companies make a profit, the public gets a needed infrastructure.

FEMALE STUDENT

And all without the government having to spend any money up front. Which is amazing.

MALE PROFESSOR

Right.

FEMALE STUDENT

Anyway… as I said in my presentation, this model’s being used in Turkey right now, and you said, when you handed out that brochure in class last week— about the university’s Global Enrichment Initiative, you said one of the countries involved in that is Turkey.

MALE PROFESSOR

Yes, that’s right.

FEMALE STUDENT

So, I wanted to see if there’s a chance… uh, the university sends fifteen students overseas to study?

MALE PROFESSOR

Fifteen students per country—fifteen for Turkey, fifteen for Brazil, fifteen for Russia…We’ve got a total of six countries participating next summer.

FEMALE STUDENT

Oh!

MALE PROFESSOR

Yeah, and you spend six weeks in whichever country you’re selected for. The classroom component consists of seminars on that country’s culture, politics, and economy. Most sessions are taught in English by local professors, but two of our faculty accompany each group and also give seminars. I’ll be going to Brazil to teach a seminar on coffee next summer.

FEMALE STUDENT

But you’re an economist!

MALE PROFESSOR

Coffee’s played a central role in Brazil’s economic development for over 200 years. About a third of the coffee consumed worldwide is produced in Brazil.

FEMALE STUDENT

Oh, I had no idea. Hmm. So, if I applied… I mean, can students pick the country they wanna go to? ’Cause if I could go to Turkey…

MALE PROFESSOR

Well, the primary goal of the Global Enrichment Initiative is simply cultural exchange… so students who’ve never been overseas before can broaden their perspective. This is why, on the application, you’re asked to indicate your first-, second-, and third-choice countries.

FEMALE STUDENT

I’m only interested in Turkey, though. I’m studying both Turkish and Turkish history this term.

MALE PROFESSOR

I see.

FEMALE STUDENT

And, maybe I could learn more about how they’re implementing the build-operate-transfer model there. Plus, I wouldn’t wanna take a spot away from someone who really wanted to go to one of the other countries.

MALE PROFESSOR

Well, I guess you could leave the second and third choices blank…
