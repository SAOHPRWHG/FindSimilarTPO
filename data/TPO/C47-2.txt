This is not what I had in mind when I assigned a film review.

MALE STUDENT

It isn’t?

FEMALE PROFESSOR

No, what you wrote is a synopsis, a detailed summary of the movie, but it’s not a review.

MALE STUDENT

It’s not? I guess I’m a little confused cause isn’t that what a film review does, you know, describe the film?

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Sure, in part, but a good review has to do more. But this is probably not your fault. I’m starting to think that I should’ve explained the assignment better, because, well, I got a lot of summaries, and very few reviews.

MALE STUDENT

So… it wasn’t only me?

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Hardly. I just assumed that everyone would know what to do…

MALE STUDENT

So, um, what else is a review supposed to do?

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Well, it should also analyze the film, discuss its strengths and weaknesses, maybe compare it to other movies, even mention why the reviewer did or didn’t like it.

MALE STUDENT

You mean it should’ve been more personal?

FEMALE PROFESSOR

For starters. Or maybe, “subjective” is a better word than “personal.” 

Yes, it should’ve been more subjective.

MALE STUDENT

Maybe I could rewrite it?

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Well, I don’t know about rewriting it. Too many people seem to have missed the point. I think I may have to forgo evaluating this one. Instead, maybe we’ll just devote a class to discussing what it takes to write a good film review, or maybe… hmm… you know, I have a colleague who writes film reviews for the local paper. Maybe I could ask her to come to class and describe what she does, and then have everyone rewrite their reviews.

MALE STUDENT

So… she would talk about what a film review should be like, so we’d know what to do?

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Well more than that… a professional film reviewer gets to see movies sometimes before they’ve even been released… they get advance copies, usually a video or DVD, to watch at home. Or they go to a movie as soon as it opens in the theaters.

MALE STUDENT

Umm… Seeing it on the big screen, in a theater, doesn’t that affect the experience?

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Of course. Having other people there… can affect the review too… So for the next assignment, I might ask everyone to review one of the films the film club shows every weekend at the theater on campus. There’s no admission charge, they’re free to students, and… the movies are shown Friday and Saturday nights, plus Sunday afternoon, so everyone should be able to see one. Yeah, that should work.

MALE STUDENT

But for this time, will we have to rewrite our reviews?



FEMALE PROFESSOR

Well, let’s take it one thing at a time. Let me talk to my colleague.
