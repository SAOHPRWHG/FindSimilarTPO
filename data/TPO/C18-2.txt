Well, I’m glad you redid your outline. Um, I’ve made a few comments, but nothing you have to act on. It’s in good enough shape for you to start writing your paper.

MALE STUDENT

Thanks. At first I was afraid all that prep work would be a waste of time.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Well, especially with a challenging topic like yours—factors leading to the emergence of sociology as an academic discipline. There’s just so much history to consider, you could get lost without a solid outline. Uh, so, did you have a question?

MALE STUDENT

Yeah, it’s about…You mentioned needing volunteers for a research study?

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Yep. It’s not my study, it’s my colleague’s in the marketing department. She needs people to watch various new TV programs that haven’t been broadcast yet. Then indicate on a survey whether they liked it, why, if they’d watch another episode…It’d be kinda fun, plus participants get a $50 gift certificate…

MALE STUDENT

Oh, well I like the sound of that! But—so they’re trying to predict if these shows are gonna succeed or fail, right? Based on students’opinions? Why would they care what we think?

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Hey, don’t sell yourself short—people your age are a very attractive market for advertisers who promote their products on television. The study’s sponsored by a TV network. If enough students don’t like a show, the network may actually reconsider putting it on the air.

MALE STUDENT

OK, well, how do I sign up?

FEMALE PROFESSOR

You just add your name and phone number to this list and check a time slot. Although it looks like the only times left are next Monday morning and Thursday evening…

MALE STUDENT

Oh, well…I have marketing and economics Monday mornings, and Thursday…

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Oh, you’re taking a marketing class? Who’s teaching it?

MALE STUDENT

It’s, uh, Professor Larkin, intro to marketing. He hasn’t mentioned the study, though.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Oh. Well…the marketing department’s pretty big. I happen to be friends with the woman who’s doing the TV study. OK, well, we don’t want you missing class…how’s Thursday?

MALE STUDENT

Oh, I work from five till nine that night.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Hmm. No flexibility with your schedule? Where do you work?

MALE STUDENT

At Fox’s Diner. I’m a server.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Oh, I love Fox’s. I eat there every week. Maybe you could switch shifts with someone.



MALE STUDENT

I’m still in training, and the only night my trainer works is Thursday.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Look, I know the owners there really well. Why don’t you let me give them a call and explain the situation?

MALE STUDENT

OK. It’d be cool to be part of a real research study. And the gift certificate wouldn’t hurt, either!
