Hi, Professor Mason. Do you have a minute?

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Yes, of course, Eric. [thinking aloud] I think there was something I wanted to talk to you about, too.

MALE STUDENT

Probably my late essay.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Ah, that must have been it. I thought maybe [upspeak] I’d lost it…

MALE STUDENT

No, I’m sorry. Actually, it was my computer that lost it, the first draft of it, and... Well anyway, I finally put it in your mailbox yesterday.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Oh, and I haven’t checked the mailbox yet today. Well, I’m glad it’s there... I’ll read it this weekend.

MALE STUDENT

Well, sorry again. Say, I can send it to you by e-mail too, if you like. 

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Great, I’ll be interested to see how it all came out.

MALE STUDENT

Right. Now, uh, [questioning] I just overheard some graduate students talking...

[upspeak] something about a party for Dean Adams?

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Retirement party, yes… all students are invited. Wasn’t there a notice on the anthropology department’s bulletin board?

MALE STUDENT

Uh, I don’t know. But... I wanted to offer to help out with it. You know, whatever you need. Dean Adams, well, I took a few anthropology classes with her, and they were great. Inspiring. And, well, I just wanted to pitch in.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Oh, that’s very thoughtful of you, Eric, but it’ll be pretty low-key. Nothing flashy. That’s not her style.

MALE STUDENT

So there’s nothing?

FEMALE PROFESSOR

No, we’ll have coffee and cookies, … maybe a cake. But actually, a couple of the administrative assistants are working on that. You could ask them, but I think they’ve got it covered.

MALE STUDENT

OK.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

[a bit hesitantly, new idea] Actually [changes mind]… no, never mind…

MALE STUDENT

[anxious to help] What is it?

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Well… It’s nothing to do with the party, and I’m sure there are more exciting ways you could spend your time, but we do need some help with something. We’re compiling a database of articles the anthropology faculty has published. There’s not much glory in it, but we’re looking for someone with some knowledge of anthropology who can enter the articles…[asking MALE STUDENT to do it, though with hesitation] I hesitate to mention it, but I don’t suppose this is something you would...   

MALE STUDENT

[enthusiastic, accepting] No, that sounds kinda cool. I’d like to see what they’re writing about.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Wonderful... and there are also some unpublished studies. Did you know Dean Adams did a lot of field research in Indonesia? Most of it hasn’t been published yet.

MALE STUDENT

No, like what?

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Well, she’s really versatile. She just spent several months studying social interactions in Indonesia, and she’s been influential in ethnology. [remembering, excited] Oh, and she’s also done work in South America that’s closer to biology—especially with speciation [SPEE shee A shun].

MALE STUDENT

Uh, not to seem uninformed…

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Well, how species form… you know, how two distinct species form from one—like when populations of the same species are isolated from each other and then develop in two different directions, and end up as two distinct species.

MALE STUDENT

Interesting.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Yes, and while she was there in South America, she collected a lot of linguistic information, and songs…really fascinating.

MALE STUDENT

Well, I hate to see her leave.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Don’t worry. She’ll still be around. She’s got lots of projects that she’s still in the middle of.
