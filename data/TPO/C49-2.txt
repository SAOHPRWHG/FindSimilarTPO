MALE PROFESSOR

Oh hi Melanie, how are you doing?

FEMALE STUDENT

I’m good thanks. I just have some questions about this paper, for your class. Do you have a second to talk about it now?

MALE PROFESSOR

Oh yes, no problem; I have about 20 minutes before my next class. Will that be enough time?

FEMALE STUDENT

Yeah I think so. Okay so the thing is, you know, okay I’m writing my paper on the history of jazz in New York City.

MALE PROFESSOR

Alright, well that’s a pretty broad subject.

FEMALE STUDENT

Well actually I’m focusing on a specific decade – the 50s – and on [short pause] and I’m only doing it on a few specific artists.

MALE PROFESSOR

Oh okay – because I was going to say that seemed a bit, ah, too ambitious for a 10 page paper.



FEMALE STUDENT

Yeah. No, it’s not the subject I’m having trouble with – actually the paper is practically writing itself, I mean I’ve got a lot to say and it’s going pretty well. The thing is, I have this idea…that might make it better and I was wondering if there’s any way I could get an extension…I mean I know it’s due next week right?

MALE PROFESSOR

That’s right, on Monday. But I don’t understand, it sounds like you’re doing so well; why do you need more time?

FEMALE STUDENT

Yeah well, I could write the paper as it is and turn it in on time and it would be fine…

MALE PROFESSOR

But…?

FEMALE STUDENT

But I was just talking to one of my friends, whose family has lived in New York forever, and it turns out that her grandfather was actually there in the period of jazz I’m writing about – I mean he was a jazz musician and he actually, like personally knew the artists I’m writing about.

MALE PROFESSOR

You’re kidding! Well that’s a coincidence.

FEMALE STUDENT

Yeah, I know, it’s cool, right? So anyway, that’s why I was wondering if I could get an extension, because I thought it would be really great if I could like, interview him, for my paper…

MALE PROFESSOR

Ah.

FEMALE STUDENT

But I don’t think I can meet with him until early next week, so…

MALE PROFESSOR

Ah I see, well! It would certainly add a new dimension to your paper, wouldn’t it?

Have you talked with this gentleman yet?

FEMALE STUDENT

Um, no, but I talked to my friend, just, you know ran the idea past her, and she said he

would probably love to do it. But, you know, he’s busy until next week.



MALE PROFESSOR

Okay well, yeah! I think that in this case we can definitely extend your deadline until, let’s say, Friday next week?

FEMALE STUDENT

Okay that would be great.

MALE PROFESSOR

But just to be fair, why don’t you turn in an outline of your paper on the due date.

FEMALE STUDENT

The outline... oh that’s no problem. It’s basically done except for the parts about the interview...

MALE PROFESSOR

Oh yeah... the interview. Could you have the questions ready then too... the ones you’re planning on asking?

FEMALE STUDENT

Sure, yeah I can do that, too.

MALE PROFESSOR

And then I’ll expect the final draft next Friday.

FEMALE STUDENT

Okay great! Thanks.

MALE PROFESSOR

Sure, I’m looking forward to reading it!
