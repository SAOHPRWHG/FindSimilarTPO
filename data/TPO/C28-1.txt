MALE STUDENT

I’m so sorry I’m late, Professor Mills. I just finished at the Student Medical Center—I twisted my ankle playing soccer this morning. It took longer than I expected to see the doctor.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

That’s OK. Don’t worry about it, David.

So, lets get started. Your paper on John Dewey’s political philosophy has a few issues I’d like to cover. You gave a great biographical sketch in the beginning. OK. But then as you get into his political philosophy, I don’t think you’ve done enough to situate his philosophy within the time period. In other words, you haven’t connected Dewey’s philosophy to the thinking of other intellectuals of the time.

MALE STUDENT

So I haven’t captured the most critical influences, the influences that were most significant to his political thinking?

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Exactly.

OK. Now look back up at this section here … where you wrote about Dewey’s view of individuality. This is all good content, but you haven’t presented the information in a systematic way. I really think this portion on individuality needs to come later—after your paragraphs on Dewey’s intellectual influences.

MALE STUDENT

After my revised paragraphs on what influenced him.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Yes, revised. Let me ask, uh, when you were finished writing, did you go back and ask yourself if all of the material was relevant?

MALE STUDENT

Well, no.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

I do think there are areas that can be cut. I guess what I’m saying is that your paragraphs aren’t really presented in a logical order … the direction of your argument isn’t crystal clear. And there’s some unnecessary material getting in the way.

MALE STUDENT

OK. Sounds like I have a lot to do.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

And one more thing … do you have a copy of the department’s document on the correct format for in-text citations and references?

MALE STUDENT

No, um, I-I mean, I looked at it online when I was working on this assignment.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

You really should print it out. You’re going to need it for every paper you write in the political science department. It looks like you were getting it mixed up with another referencing system.

MALE STUDENT

Oh. Y ah, I used something different in high school. It’s so confusing switching to a new system.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

I know, but remember—everything needs to be consistent when it comes to referencing. It’s a very important academic convention.

Oh—also, I wanted to ask you … will you be at the Political Science Club meeting Saturday?

MALE STUDENT

Definitely. The topic’s John Dewey!

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Yes. Are you interested in leading part of the discussion? Tom Hayward is looking for someone to help out. I think you’ll have a lot to contribute.

MALE STUDENT

That’d be fun! I’ll give him a call.
