FEMALE PROFESSOR

Jeff, I’m glad you dropped by! I’ve been meaning to congratulate you on the Class Leadership Award.

MALE STUDENT

Thanks, Professor Bronson. I was really happy to get it! And a little surprised…I mean, there were so many other people nominated.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Well, I know the award was well-deserved! Now, what can I do for you today?

MALE STUDENT

I needed to talk to you about the Medieval History test—you know, the one scheduled for Friday afternoon.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Yes…

MALE STUDENT

Well, there’s this trip that my French class is taking. We’re going to Montreal for the weekend—

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Montreal?! That’s my favorite city! What’ll you be seeing there?

MALE STUDENT

Uh, I’m not sure yet—the reason, the main reason I wanted to go is that we’ll be rooming with French-speaking students there—you know, so we can get a chance to use our French…to actually talk with real French speakers.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

It sounds like a great opportunity…but then, there’s that test…

MALE STUDENT

Yeah, but—well, the thing is, the bus leaves right in the middle of when our history class meets this Friday… so,—well…I was thinking… maybe I could take the test on a different day…like, Monday morning, during your office hours.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Ah… Monday morning… Mmm… that would not be—wait, let me just see one thing… Ah ha… okay that’s what I thought. So… for your class, I was planning a take-home exam. So… you could just take the test along with you… Let’s see… I guess you could come to class Friday just to pick up the test—that way you’d still make your bus… and then, find some quiet time during your trip to complete it… and… you can bring it to class Wednesday, when I’ll be collecting everyone else’s.

MALE STUDENT

Mmm… During the trip… well, I guess I could… So, I should plan to take my books ’n’ stuff with me.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

You’ll definitely need your class notes. I’m giving you several short essay questions—to make you think critically about the points we’ve discussed in class—to state, uh… state and defend your opinion… analyze the issues… speculate about how things might have turned out differently. So, you see, I don’t care if you look up dates and that kind of thing. What I want is for you to synthesize information, to reflect back on what we’ve read and discussed, and to form your own ideas…not just repeat points from the textbook. Does that make sense?

MALE STUDENT

Yeah, I think so—you’re looking for my point of view.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

That’s right. The midterm exam showed me that you know all the details of who, where, and when. For this test, I want to see how you can put it all together to show some original thinking.

MALE STUDENT

That sounds pretty challenging—especially trying to work it into this trip—but, yeah, I think I can do it.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

I’m sure you can!

MALE STUDENT

Thank you, Professor Bronson.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Have a great time in Montreal!
