MALE STUDENT

Hi. I’m not sure but... um, is this the Carter Language Lab?

FEMALE MANAGER

Yes, it is. How can I help you?

MALE STUDENT

I’m taking first-year Spanish this semester. Our professor says we need to come here to view a series of videos. I think it’s called Spanish: Working on Your Accent.

FEMALE MANAGER

Yes, we have that... Um, they’re on the wall behind you.

MALE STUDENT

OK, so… I can just take …can I just take the whole series home? I think there are three of them …

FEMALE MANAGER

I guess you haven’t been here before… 

MALE STUDENT

No, no I haven’t.

FEMALE MANAGER

OK, well, you have to watch the videos here. You need to sign in to reserve an open room, and sign out the video you need. Just start with the first one in the series--each video’s half an hour long. 

MALE STUDENT

So it’s a video library, basically?

FEMALE MANAGER

Yes, but unlike the library, you can’t take any videos out of the lab.

MALE STUDENT

OK... So, how long can I use a video room for?

FEMALE MANAGER

You can sign up for two hours at a time.

MALE STUDENT

Oh good. So I can watch more than one video when I come up here. Is the lab pretty busy all the time?

FEMALE MANAGER

Well, rooms are usually full right after dinnertime. Uh, but you can sign up the day before to reserve a room if you want... 

MALE STUDENT

Hmmm, the day before . . . But I can just stop in too . . . to see if there’re any rooms open, right?

FEMALE MANAGER

Sure. Stop in anytime.

MALE STUDENT

Um, what about copies of the videos? Is there just one copy of each in the series? I don’t want to miss out if everyone comes in at once.

FEMALE MANAGER

Oh, no. Uh, we have several copies of each tape in the Spanish accent series. We usually have multiple copies of everything for each video collection.

MALE STUDENT

Super. So how many rooms are there in total in the lab?

FEMALE MANAGER

Twenty. They’re pretty small, so we normally get one person or no more than a small group of people in there watching a video together. Actually, someone else from your class just came in and took the first Spanish video in to watch. You could probably run in there and watch it with him. Of course, you’re welcome to have your own room, but sometimes students like to watch with a classmate so they can review the material with each other afterwards... for example, if there was some content they didn’t really understand.

MALE STUDENT

I guess I’d prefer my own room. I concentrate better by myself... and I don’t want to miss anything... hm and he’s probably already started watching it... 

FEMALE MANAGER

No problem--we’ve got a lot of rooms open right now. When you come in, you sign your name on the list and are assigned a room number. Or if you call in advance, the attendant will tell you your room number. If you forget, just come in and take a look at the list.

The videos are over there.
