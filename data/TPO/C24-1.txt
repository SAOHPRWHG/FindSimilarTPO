Hi, can you tell me where to find New Kind of Science by ah, by Steven Wolfram…

FEMALE CLERK

OK.

MALE STUDENT

…I, ah, couldn’t find it.

FEMALE CLERK

OK, let me look it up on the computer for you. Who did you say the author was?

MALE STUDENT

Um, it’s Steven Wolfram.

FEMALE CLERK

OK, let’s see… no, it’s not coming up… mh, I’m not seeing it…

MALE STUDENT

Um…

FEMALE CLERK

This is for a class here at the university, right?

MALE STUDENT

Yeah, it’s assigned reading for a class I’m, I’m taking.

FEMALE CLERK

It’s for this semester, right? You’re not buying it in advance for next year or anything…

MALE STUDENT

No no, it’s for a class I’m taking now…

FEMALE CLERK

Hmmm…

MALE STUDENT

Oh, but you know what? It’s for a graduate class. Would that maybe make a difference? I mean, I’m an undergrad, but I’m just, I’m just taking this one class in the graduate department, so maybe…

FEMALE CLERK

No, no, I don’t think that’s it. That shouldn’t make any difference, but, mh, let me see… maybe it’s just… it could be that whoever entered it misspelled the title or the author’s name, so I can’t find it on the computer, and I can’t tell if it’s sold out. But if it is sold out, we would probably be getting a new shipment within about a week or so.

MALE STUDENT

OK, well I was hoping to get it sooner, ’cause like we already have assignments and, you know. I mean I guess I could get it from the library…

FEMALE CLERK

Right, of course.… But I’m trying to check; if we’ve ordered more, then that backorder information should be in the computer too. Let’s see… backorder-Wolfram-Steven… no… I’m still not seeing it. I’m sorry, we just don’t seem to carry it.

MALE STUDENT

Uh-huh.

FEMALE CLERK

This is odd, though. What is… what’s your professor’s name? I could try searching for his or her classes in the database, that might help.

MALE STUDENT

Um, OK, it’s Professor Kayne.

FEMALE CLERK

K-A-N-E?

MALE STUDENT

No, it’s Professor Kayne, K-A-Y-N-E. He’s in the computer science department.

FEMALE CLERK

Oh! It’s for a computer science course, is it?

MALE STUDENT

Yeah…?

FEMALE CLERK

Ah-ha! That must be it. Computer science books are sold across the street in the computer store.

MALE STUDENT

Ooh… are there signs up anywhere?

FEMALE CLERK

I don’t know.

MALE STUDENT

May be they should put some up… could’ve saved us both some time.

FEMALE CLERK

Yeah, well anyway, I’ll bet that’s the problem. Check across the street. I’ll bet they have it, but if not, come back and I’ll help you find it somewhere else; I can call around to see if other bookstores might have it. OK?

MALE STUDENT

OK, thanks a lot! Bye.

FEMALE CLERK

Bye.
