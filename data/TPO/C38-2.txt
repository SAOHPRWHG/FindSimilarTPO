FEMALE PROFESSOR

How’s it going, Tom?

MALE STUDENT

Great. I was—oh! I wanted to tell you… y’know the guest speaker you brought into class last week, from the wildlife conservation center?

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Susan Brown, yes. She’s an old friend from graduate school.

MALE STUDENT

Her talk, on wildlife-population modeling… well, it was very theoretical…

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Mmm. It was certainly a change of pace from what we usually do.

MALE STUDENT

Yeah, but I think I pretty much followed along. Plus, I like to see people get so passionate about ecology…

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Oh right… ecology’s your major field of study, isn’t it… yes, Susan Brown’s certainly a lively speaker. What a shame she didn’t go into teaching.

MALE STUDENT

Um, anyway, what I—[blabbering before he gets to his point] Well, a while ago, I saw this blurb in the school paper about a—an exchange program, that’s part of the study-abroad office…uh, and today there was a booth set up in the student center with a coupla students answering questions about the university’s programs in foreign countries. Seeing the booth reminded me about the article in the paper and…

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Thinking about going abroad in the coming year?

MALE STUDENT

Actually, I just spent last summer studying in Tokyo… I think that satisfied my urge to travel…

FEMALE PROFESSOR

It must’ve been quite an experience.

MALE STUDENT

Definitely. Taking all those language courses was really challenging. But what I wanted to find out at the booth was… it’s, um, a domestic exchange program. Not studying abroad, but studying for a year somewhere else here in the United States.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

I don’t think I’ve heard of that.

MALE STUDENT

Well, neither had the guys in the booth. They didn’t know what I was talking about. But when I talked to the supervisor in the study-abroad office, it turns out we’re part of a—a group of universities throughout the U.S. that does a domestic-exchange program.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Huh! So, you spend, what, a year at another university, and your classes count toward your degree here…?

MALE STUDENT

Yeah, and I’d pay the same fees… tuition, room, and board… that I pay here. So it doesn’t really cost any extra.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Interesting.

MALE STUDENT

And, y’know, I’ve lived here in southern Florida my whole life. And I’ve always been interested in Montana… the university in Montana, where I want to go, has classes that deal specifically with the ecology there, like… I’m interested in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. It’s such an important ecosystem, being the source of three major rivers, and I want to learn more about it.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Wow, this is a unique idea. The climate, the plants, and wildlife… it’s really different from here. Probably the culture too, in a way. And don’t forget about all the outdoor activities you could do there…hiking, skiing, and the national parks…

MALE STUDENT

That’s true. Uh, anyway, I’ll have to get my application together in the next month or so. And I’ll need two letters of recommendation… one from a professor in my major department…

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Consider it done.

MALE STUDENT

Thanks.
