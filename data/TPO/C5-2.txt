Hi. I was wondering if I could talk with you about the assignment in the Film Theory class?

MALE PROFESSOR

Of course, Jill.

FEMALE STUDENT

It seems that pretty much everyone else in the class gets what they’re supposed to be doing, but I’m not so sure.

MALE PROFESSOR

Well, the class is for students who are really serious about film. You must have taken film courses before?

FEMALE STUDENT

Yeah, in high school, Film Appreciation.

MALE PROFESSOR

Hmm, I wouldn’t think that’d be enough. Did you concentrate mainly on form, or content?

FEMALE STUDENT

Oh, definitely content. We’d watch, say, Lord of the Flies, and then discuss it.



MALE PROFESSOR

Oh, that approach…treating film as literature, ignoring what makes it unique…

FEMALE STUDENT

I liked it, though…

MALE PROFESSOR

Sure, but that kind of class…well, I’m not surprised you’re feeling a little lost. Y’know, we have two introductory courses that are supposed to be taken before you get to my course—one in film art, techniques…technical stuff…and another in film history. So students in the class you’re in should be pretty far along in film studies. In fact, usually the system blocks anyone trying to sign up for a class they shouldn’t be taking, who hasn’t taken the courses you’re required to do first, as prerequisites.

FEMALE STUDENT

Well, I did have a problem with that, but I discussed it with one of your office staff and she gave me permission.

MALE PROFESSOR

Of course. No matter how many times I tell them, they just keep on… Well, for your own good, I’d really suggest dropping back and starting at the usual place…

FEMALE STUDENT

Yes, but... I’ve already been in this class for four weeks! I’d hate to just drop it now, especially since I find it so different, so interesting.

MALE PROFESSOR

I guess so—frankly, I can’t believe you’ve lasted this long! These are pretty in-depth theories we’ve been discussing, and you’ve been doing OK so far, I guess. But, still, the program’s been designed to progress through certain stages. Like any other professional training, we build on previous knowledge.

FEMALE STUDENT

Then maybe you could recommend some extra reading I can do, to catch up?

MALE PROFESSOR

Well, are you intending to study film, as your main concentration?

FEMALE STUDENT

No. No, I—I’m just interested; I’m actually in marketing, but there seems to be a connection…

MALE PROFESSOR

Oh, well, in case…if you’re taking the course just out of … I mean, I’d still highly recommend signing up for the introductory courses at some point. But in the meantime, there’s no harm, I guess, in trying to keep up with this class. The interest is clearly there. Uh, instead of any extra reading just now, though, you could view some of the old introductory lectures—we have ’em on video—that’d give you a better handle on the subject. It’s still a pretty tall order, and we’ll be moving right along, so you’ll really need to stay on top of it.

FEMALE STUDENT

OK, I’ve been warned. Now, could I tell you about my idea for the assignment…?
