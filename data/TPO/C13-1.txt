Good afternoon, Alex. Can I help you with something?

MALE STUDENT

Well, I wanted to talk with you about the research project you assigned today. I, um, hoped you could clarify a few things for me.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

I’ll certainly try.

MALE STUDENT

OK, all we have to do is do two observations and take notes on them, right?

FEMALE PROFESSOR

That’s a start —but you’ll need to do some research, too. Then you’ll write a paper that’s not so much about the observations, but a synthesis of what you’ve observed and read.

MALE STUDENT

OK…and what about the children I’m supposed to observe?

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Not ‘children’—a single child, observed twice.

MALE STUDENT

Oh! OK. So I should choose a child—with the permission of the child’s parent, of course—and then observe that child a couple of times and take good notes. Then?

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Actually, after your first observation, you’ll go back and look through your textbook or go to the library and find a few sources concerning the stage of development this particular child is in. And then with that knowledge, you’ll make a second observation of the same child to see if the expected developmental behaviors are exhibited.

MALE STUDENT

Can you give me an example?

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Well, um, if you observed a four-year-old child—uh, for example, my daughter is four years old—you might read up on Piaget’s stages of cognitive development. We covered those in class.

MALE STUDENT

Uh-huh.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Most likely, what stage would a child of that age be in?

MALE STUDENT

Um…the preoperational stage?

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Exactly. If that’s the case, her language use would be maturing, and her memory and imagination would be developed.

MALE STUDENT

So she might play pretend! Like, she can pretend when driving her toy car across the couch that the couch is actually a bridge or something.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

That’s right. In addition, her thinking would be primarily egocentric.

MALE STUDENT

So she’d be thinking mostly about herself and her own needs and might not be able to see things from anyone else’s perspective.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Um hmm.

MALE STUDENT

But…what if she doesn’t? I mean, what if she doesn’t demonstrate those behaviors?

FEMALE PROFESSOR

That’s fine. You’ll note that in your paper. See, your paper should compare what is expected of children at certain stages of development with what you actually observe.

MALE STUDENT

OK. I have one more question, though.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

And what’s that?

MALE STUDENT

Where can I find a child to observe?

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Um, I’d suggest you contact the education department secretary. She has a list of contacts at various schools and with certain families who are somehow connected to the university. Sometimes they are willing to help out students with projects like yours.

MALE STUDENT

OK, I’ll stop by the education department office this afternoon.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

And if you have any trouble or any more questions, feel free to come by during my office hours.
