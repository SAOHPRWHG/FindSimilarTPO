MALE STUDENT

Hi, I bought this book at the beginning of the semester, but something’s come up, and I’d like to return it.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

Well, for a full refund, store policy is that you have to return merchandise two weeks from the time it was purchased, but for assigned textbooks or anything having to do with specific courses… wait, was it for a specific course?

MALE STUDENT

Yes, but , uh, actually…

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

Well, for course books, the deadline is four weeks after the beginning of the semester. So for this fall semester, the deadline was October first.

MALE STUDENT

Ouch! Then I missed it. But, uh, why October first?

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

I guess the reasoning is that by October first, the semester is in full gear and everyone kinda knows what courses they’ll be taking that semester.

MALE STUDENT

I get it. So, it’s mainly for people who decide to withdraw from… uh, to change to new courses early on… 

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

Exactly. The books have to be in perfect condition of course; they can’t be marked up or look used in any way. For the full refund, I mean.

MALE STUDENT

Well, but uh, see, my situation is a little different… I-I hoped you might be able to make an exception.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

Well, the policies are generally pretty rigid—and the semester is almost over.

MALE STUDENT

OK—here’s what happened… uh, I think my professor really miscalculated. Anyway, the syllabus was way too ambitious in my opinion. There are only two weeks of classes left in the semester, and there are, like, six books on the syllabus that we haven’t even touched.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

I see. So you were hoping to return this one.

MALE STUDENT

Yeah—the professor already announced that we won’t be reading this one by Jane Bowles. And all the others I bought used.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

Jane Bowles? Which book of hers?

MALE STUDENT

It’s called Two Serious Ladies.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

Oh! But you should keep that one! Are you interested in literature?

MALE STUDENT

Well, I am an English major…

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

You’re lucky to have a professor who includes a lesser-known writer like her on the syllabus. You know, not the usual authors we’ve all read.

MALE STUDENT

So you really think, uh …?

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

I do, and especially if you’re into literature. 

MALE STUDENT

Hmm, well, I wasn’t expecting. I mean, uh, wow!

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

I hope you don’t think I’m being too pushy. If you prefer, you can return the book and arrange for a store credit. You don’t qualify for a refund—policy is policy, after all—but you can make an exchange. And you can use the credit for your books for next semester. The credit carries over from one semester to the next.

MALE STUDENT

Hmm—that’s good to know. But now I’m really intrigued. I guess that just because we ran out of time to read this book in class doesn’t mean that I can’t read it on my own time. You know, I think I’ll give it a try.
