So, Richard … what’s up?

MALE STUDENT

Well, I know we have a test coming up on chapters . . . uh . . .

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Chapters 3 and 4 from your textbook …

MALE STUDENT

Right...3 and 4. Well, I, uh...I didn’t get something you said in class Monday.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Alright, do you remember what it was about?

MALE STUDENT

Yeah, you were talking about a gym...a health club, where people can go to exercise … that kind of thing.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

OK. But the health-club model is actually from chapter 5, so . . .

MALE STUDENT

Uh, chapter 5? Oh, so it’s not... OK, but I guess I still want to try to under—…

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Of course. Well, I was talking about an issue in strategic marketing. Um, the health-club model, um… I mean, with a health club, you might think they would have trouble attracting customers, right?

MALE STUDENT

Well, I know when I pass by a health club and I see all those people working out... exercising … I’d just as soon walk on by! 

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Yeah, there’s that, plus... lots of people have exercise equipment at home, or they can play sports with their friends, right?

MALE STUDENT

Sure.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

But nowadays, in spite of all that, and expensive membership fees, health clubs are hugely popular. So, how come?

MALE STUDENT

I guess that’s what I didn’t understand.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

OK. Basically, they have to offer things that most people can’t find anywhere else—You know, quality. That means better exercise equipment, high-end stuff. Um, and... classes... exercise classes, maybe aerobics...

MALE STUDENT

I’m not sure if I... oh, OK,I get it.. . Yeah. And you know, another thing is, I think people probably feel good about themselves when they’re at the gym. And they can meet new people, socialize...

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Right. So, health clubs offer high-quality facilities, and also, they sell an image... about people having more fun, relating better to others, and improving their own lives, if they become members.

MALE STUDENT

Sure. That makes sense.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Well then, uh, can you think of another business or organization that could benefit from doing this?

MALE STUDENT

Um.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Think about an important building on campus here, something everyone uses . .. a major source of... information.

MALE STUDENT

You mean like, an administrative building?

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Well, that’s not what I had in mi—

MALE STUDENT

Oh! You mean the library?

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Exactly. Libraries. Imagine public libraries.... They’re an information resource for the whole community, right?

MALE STUDENT

Well, they can be, but... now, with the Internet, and big bookstores, you can probably get what you need without going to a library.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

That’s true. So, if you were the director of a public library, what would you do about that?

MALE STUDENT

To get more people to stop in?Well, like you said, better equipment. Maybe a super-fast Internet connection. And not just a good variety of books, but also, like, nice, comfortable areas where people can read and do research. Things that make them want to come to the library, and stay.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Great.

MALE STUDENT

Oh, and... maybe have authors come and do some readings? Or, I don’t know.. . special presentations. Something people couldn’t get at home.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Now you’re getting it.

MALE STUDENT

Thanks, Professor Wilkins. I think so too …
