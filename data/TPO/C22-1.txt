FEMALE STUDENT：Hi … I’m sorry to bother you, but …

MALE ADVISOR：Yes?

FEMALE STUDENT：This is about the newspaper …

MALE ADVISOR：Oh, OK. Well, I’m only the adviser—uh, the newspaper office is off campus, on Pine Street. Uh, what was it? Did you want to work for the paper? We’re always looking for writers.

FEMALE STUDENT：Well, my problem was with the writing, actually. With an article that was published in yesterday’s newspaper.

MALE ADVISOR：Oh? Uh, which one?

FEMALE STUDENT：The one about the student government and its president, Sally Smith.

MALE ADVISOR：Is this something to do with what the editor wrote about the statue? Uh, the statue at the main entrance of the university?

FEMALE STUDENT：Well, that’s part of it. But, you know, the editor used this situation to say some really unfair things … a-about the student government and the president, Sally Smith, in particular. I think the paper should publish a retraction—or at the very least an apology to Sally.

MALE ADVISOR：OK, um...if I remember correctly, what you’re referring to wasn’t a news story, but an editorial, right? It was on the opinion page? It was signed by one of the editors and was clearly labeled as commentary …

FEMALE STUDENT：Well, yes, but the thing about the statue—Sally made the simple comment that it was in really bad condition and should be replaced, and, well, the tone in the editorial was demeaning. It accused her of not respecting the past. And it had some personal stuff that seemed unnecessary.

MALE ADVISOR：Uh, wait a minute … uh, remind me.

FEMALE STUDENT：Well, you know, it implied that Sally doesn’t know much about the university’s history, and it called her a “big-city politician,” because she’s from Boston—it’s just mean-spirited, isn’t it?

MALE ADVISOR：Haven’t you heard the saying “All publicity is good publicity”?

FEMALE STUDENT：Well …

MALE ADVISOR：I’d say the article is bringing attention to the student government organization, which is pretty invisible. Uh, you rarely hear about what student government is doing.

FEMALE STUDENT：But, this article …

MALE ADVISOR：And the piece, well, it had a bit of an exaggerated tone. It was satirical, or at least it was meant to be. It wasn’t only poking fun at Sally but the whole idea that our school is sort of rural, and, you know, not cosmopolitan.

FEMALE STUDENT：Well, none of us thought it was very funny.

MALE ADVISOR：Well, sometimes it’s best just to roll with it. It’s just a cliché. Everybody knows it’s not true.

FEMALE STUDENT：But I thought we could expect better than that here.

MALE ADVISOR：Well, I’m certainly in favor of getting a variety of viewpoints. So why don’t you go talk to the editor—Jennifer Hamilton—and tell her you want equal time. You or Sally can write a response.

FEMALE STUDENT：[quite skeptical] Really? She’d let us do that? …  didn’t she write it?

MALE ADVISOR：I’ll let Jennifer know you’re coming; she feels the same way I do—she’s a journalism major. She’d be happy to publish another point of view.
