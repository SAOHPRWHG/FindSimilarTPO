MALE EMPLOYEE

Sorry you had to wait. It’s a busy time of year—lots of people mailing packages home…

FEMALE STUDENT

I bet. I’ll have to come next week to do that … I’m moving out of my dorm, and I’m sending some papers home.

MALE EMPLOYEE

OK, we’ll be here… what can I do for you today?

FEMALE STUDENT

Well, my roommate asked me to pick something up for her. I told her I was coming down here… She got this notice saying there was a package to pick up—I guess it was too big to fit into her mailbox.

MALE EMPLOYEE

I’m sorry, but I can only give packages to the person who they’re addressed to—it’s university policy.

FEMALE STUDENT

Really? Could you make an exception? She is my roommate.

MALE EMPLOYEE

I wish I could, but … she’ll have to come and get it herself—and be sure to tell her to have her student ID card on her. We’ll need to see identification—oh, and she’ll need that package notification too.

FEMALE STUDENT

OK, I’ll let her know. Um, also … since I’m moving, I’ll be able to receive my mail at my new apartment, so … I don’t really need my campus mailbox.

MALE EMPLOYEE

Oh, OK. Although I should tell you that we do recommend that students use the campus mailbox service, even if they are moving off campus.

FEMALE STUDENT

Really? Why?

MALE EMPLOYEE

Well, if any of your professors want to notify you of changes to class schedules—or get in touch with you for any reason…

FEMALE STUDENT

My professors have my e-mail address. 

MALE EMPLOYEE

Yes, that’s true … but remember things like university newsletters, flyers from university clubs, notices about special events … they’re only distributed to campus mailboxes. None of that’s mailed off campus.

FEMALE STUDENT

Well, I work at the college newspaper, so I should be able to keep on top of what’s going on. Plus there’s the bulletin board outside the dining hall …

MALE EMPLOYEE

True, but... You know, if it’s the campus mailbox fee, I might be able to offer you a less expensive rate for next year. We can do that, in special circumstances.

FEMALE STUDENT

Thanks, but … I mean, I can afford the mailbox fee. It’s just that between my off-campus address, my e-mail account, and the school newspaper, I don’t think there’ll be a problem.

MALE EMPLOYEE

OK. In that case, stop by the main desk on your way out of the building and pick up the form you’ll need … and don’t forget to include a forwarding mail address for anything that’s addressed to your box from outside the university.
