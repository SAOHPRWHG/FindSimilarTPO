MALE MANAGER

Oh, hi, uh, you’re Amy, right?

 

FEMALE STUDENT

Yes.

 

MALE MANAGER

I haven’t seen you here for a while. Welcome back.

 

FEMALE STUDENT

Thanks, er, you’re right, I haven’t been eating here regularly like I used to.

 

MALE MANAGER

Why not?

 

FEMALE STUDENT

Couple of reasons. First of all, I have a class that ends during lunchtime. So, by the time I get here, there’s hardly any food left.

 

MALE MANAGER

[genuinely concerned] Really?

 

FEMALE STUDENT

Yeah. And then, I have chemistry lab at night this semester. It’s two hours every Tuesday and Thursday. Y’know, that building’s way across campus. So I just eat something in my dorm before I leave, or skip dinner altogether. I’d come here afterward, but lab lets out at seven-thirty, and by then, the cafeteria’s already closed.

 

MALE MANAGER

[sympathetically] Oh, I’m really sorry. Uh, what about getting something to go and eating it in class?

 

FEMALE STUDENT

I can’t. Food isn’t permitted anywhere near the laboratories. I wish you stayed open later.

 

MALE MANAGER

Have you complained formally? We’ve always had a suggestion box, and now, you can send us an e-mail.

 

FEMALE STUDENT

As a matter of fact, I did fill out a suggestion card. I asked for longer hours and for better food choices, too. But, that was, like, weeks ago, and nothing’s changed, from what I can see.

 

MALE MANAGER

Y’know, I was just promoted to cafeteria manager, and one of the things I’m trying to do is pay more attention to students’ concerns. There have been a lot of complaints similar to yours over the years

 

FEMALE STUDENT

Yeah, a lot of my friends complain about the cafeteria, but we figure nothing will ever be done.

 

MALE MANAGER

Well, some things can change. For instance, you mentioned you’d like better food choices. Is there anything in particular you’d like added to our menu?

 

FEMALE STUDENT

I guess it’d be nice to get hot cereal in the morning, and maybe a wider choice of soups and salads at lunch and dinner. And, there should definitely be enough food to feed everyone whenever the cafeteria’s open.

 

MALE MANAGER

Hmmm. All good suggestions. Say, were you aware that the university has recently formed a food advisory committee? It includes myself, a nutritionist, the school chef, a food-science professor, and the person who oversees the cafeteria budget.

 

FEMALE STUDENT

Do you want me to talk to the committee?

 

MALE MANAGER

I was thinking you might like to serve on the committee. If you’re interested, I’ll recommend you as the student representative.

 

FEMALE STUDENT

[reluctantly] Ohhhh, I’m not sure if I have enough spare time to get that involved.

 

MALE MANAGER

OK, then, why don’t I let you know when and where our next meeting is, and we’ll put you on the agenda? You may also want to send me an e-mail with all of your suggestions. Now that I’m in charge, I’ll make sure they’ll get serious consideration.

 

FEMALE STUDENT

I’d appreciate that. Thanks!
