FEMALE HOUSING EMPLOYEE

Hi, can I help you?

MALE STUDENT

I hope so. Uh, I’m taking a class this summer, and I need to see about getting campus housing…

FEMALE HOUSING EMPLOYEE

Ooh, sorry… I’m afraid the deadline to apply for summer housing in the dormitories has already passed. I could help you look for something off campus…

MALE STUDENT

Well, see, I-I, uh, only found out yesterday I need to take this course. It wasn’t really my idea; I mean…I was gonna take it in the fall; it’s a course I need for my major, in cognitive science—Professor Wilson was supposed to teach it, but now…

FEMALE HOUSING EMPLOYEE

Oh, right; I heard he’s taking a last-minute leave of absence next year. I-I hope everything’s OK…?

MALE STUDENT

Oh, yeah—he’ll be in Botswana, helping develop the new cognitive science program at our sister university there. Anyway, I have to take the course this summer if I want to graduate on time… I’ve got a note from the dean approving the whole situation.

FEMALE HOUSING EMPLOYEE

Ah—well, in-in that case, I guess we’d better make an exception for you! Only problem is, most of the better rooms are gone already… Was there any particular dorm you were interested in?

MALE STUDENT

Well, I’m in Randall Hall right now, but my roommate’s graduating in May, so I’ve signed up for a single in Murphy for the fall. Room 206. I was hoping I might be able to just move in there now…?

FEMALE HOUSING EMPLOYEE

Well, let’s see what the computer says… Sorry, that room’s scheduled for repainting and maintenance over the summer, so I can’t give it to you.

MALE STUDENT

Oh, I don’t really care if it’s repainted; I’ll be covering most of the walls with posters anyway. Couldn’t I just take it as is?

FEMALE HOUSING EMPLOYEE

Sorry, no—it’s actually a city ordinance—all rental rooms, including dorm rooms, have to be painted at least once every five years.

MALE STUDENT

Oh… Well, uh, how about if I stay where I am for the summer? I’m pretty sure they just painted it a couple years ago.

FEMALE HOUSING EMPLOYEE

Hang on, lemme check… You said Randall, right?

MALE STUDENT

Uh-huh, Room 122.

FEMALE HOUSING EMPLOYEE

Oops, ’fraid not—the entire floor is taken.

MALE STUDENT

Oh, well…guess I’ll just have to move twice…

FEMALE HOUSING EMPLOYEE

One sec, I’ve got one more idea… Here we go; there’s a room open in Murphy just down the hall from your new one. That way, come fall, you’d only have to carry your things a few doors down.

MALE STUDENT

Hmm, OK—works for me!

FEMALE HOUSING EMPLOYEE

Now, that room’s a double; right now you’ve got it to yourself, but there’s a chance someone else might sign up at the last minute—not likely, but you could end up with a roommate for the summer. Would that be OK?

MALE STUDENT

Oh, sure—I can get along with anyone for a couple of months!

FEMALE HOUSING EMPLOYEE

OK, then. I’ll get the forms printed up; they should be ready for you by tomorrow afternoon. You can stop by and sign them then.

MALE STUDENT

Excellent, thanks!
