FEMALE ADVISOR

Hi, Mark. What can I do for you?

MALE STUDENT

I’m just filling out this approval-for-graduation form for the dean’s office and, I don’t know …I hope I’ll be able to graduate next semester.

FEMALE ADVISOR

Well, as long as you’ve met the departmental requirements and you submit the form on time… you shouldn’t have any problem. Make sure you include all the classes you will have taken for your degree in finance…and the electives, too.

MALE STUDENT

Yeah, but as I looked over the form, I got confused because of the way, um, they’ve changed the requirements, so now I’m not sure I’ll qualify to graduate next semester. I know I would’ve before…under the old requirements.

FEMALE ADVISOR

Well, when the business department changed the curriculum, to include more courses in international business to—well—because of the increasing globalization of business—we made sure that students who had finished their second year, that is … those who were in their third or fourth year…wouldn’t be affected. The new rules only apply to students in their first or second year.

MALE STUDENT

Huh, that’s good to know. Um, the department’s hiring new faculty, too, I heard … to teach some of the new courses, but I want to…

FEMALE ADVISOR

Yes, one new faculty member has been hired. She’ll be teaching international banking, as a matter of fact.

MALE STUDENT

Actually, that’s what I wanted to ask about—international banking. I took International Banking 1, but I never took International Banking 2. It used to be that the second semester of International Banking was an elective, but now it says it’s a required class.

FEMALE ADVISOR

Yes, but that’s one of the recent changes, so …

MALE STUDENT

Oh, oh, OK. Oh, an-and I’m planning to take a management course next semester, but I don’t know if it’s …if it’ll count toward my major.

FEMALE ADVISOR

What’s the course?

MALE STUDENT

Organizational Behavior.

FEMALE ADVISOR

Yes, that’ll count toward your major. That’s a difficult class, you know, but well worth it. So, it looks like you’ll have all the required classes you need. You should be just fine—Uh, I assume you’ve taken a seminar … 

MALE STUDENT

Yeah, I-I took the marketing seminar.

FEMALE ADVISOR

OK … you’re looking good. Just to be on the safe side, why don’t you talk to someone in the dean’s office before you give them the form?

MALE STUDENT

OK. So, should I just explain to them that even though one of these classes got changed from an elective to a required class, I don’t have to take it?

FEMALE ADVISOR

Yes, you’ve met the requirements for graduation… And if there’s something I need to do, if I-if I need to write a letter, or whatever—just let me know.

MALE STUDENT

OK, thanks - I’ll let you know if I need that letter.
