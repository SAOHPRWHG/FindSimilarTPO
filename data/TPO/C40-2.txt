Mr. Reese? I’m Jennifer Lee.[upspeak]I-I worked on the photography exhibition last year, the one commemorating the university’s 100th[one-hundredth]anniversary. I helped select and display photos for the exhibit; I helped set it all up, remember?

MALE LIBRARIAN

Oh, sure…you’re the photography student that Professor Ryan sent to us. How have you been?

FEMALE STUDENT

Good, thanks. And I, ah…well, I was hoping I could talk to you about a job, actually.

MALE LIBRARIAN

[surprised]Oh, the job here in the library archive? That was fast; we just posted it yesterday.

FEMALE STUDENT

Oh, no, actually it’s for a photography job…in the portrait studio at the mall.

MALE LIBRARIAN

Taking portrait photos? Sounds like a great job for a photography student.[puzzled]But, how can I help?

FEMALE STUDENT

Well, I went for an interview. But I still need to give them professional references from people I’ve worked for. And…well, I don’t have a lot of work experience, but, you know, you’ve-you’ve seen how—how I helped plan and carry a project through, and showed up on time and everything. So, I was kinda hoping I-y’know, I could give them your name as someone they could talk to?

MALE LIBRARIAN

Of course. We all thought you did a great job. Ah, I remember saying that to Professor Ryan, and he thought so, too. I suppose you’ve already asked him for a recommendation?

FEMALE STUDENT

I have. He’s actually the one who convinced me to apply for it. I wasn’t sure I should. I mean, having real photography experience would be great for my résumé. But…well, I’m a little concerned about the hours. It’s ten hours a week, which is fine, but they’re all during the daytime. I’d have to schedule several classes for the late afternoon and evening. I’m not sure I’ll be able to do that.

MALE LIBRARIAN

Yeah, I see how that could be a problem.[thought occurs]Well, maybe you should consider the job I mentioned. We just got a grant to hire a part-time library assistant for our photography archives. It doesn’t involve taking pictures, but it does involve working with pictures…um, filling requests for specific photos from students and professors. And it’s in the evenings, from 6 to 9, three days a week.

FEMALE STUDENT

Hmm…well, the hours are definitely better. But I really do wanna find out about that job at the studio first… I’m sure you understand.

MALE LIBRARIAN

Of course. But if it doesn’t work out, keep us in mind.
