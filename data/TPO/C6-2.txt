Professor Martin?

MALE PROFESSOR

Hi, Lisa—what can I do for you?

FEMALE STUDENT

Well, I’ve been thinking about, you know, what you were saying in class last week? About how we shouldn’t wait until the last minute to find an idea and get started working on our term paper?

MALE PROFESSOR

Good, good. And have you come up with anything?

FEMALE STUDENT

Well, yeah, sort of—see, I’ve never had a linguistics class before, so I was sort of…I mean, I was looking over the course description, and a lot of the stuff you’ve described there, I just don’t know what it’s talking about, you know? Or what it means. But there was one thing that really did jump out at me…

MALE PROFESSOR

Yes…?

FEMALE STUDENT

The section on dialects? ’Cause like, that’s the kind of thing that’s always sort of intrigued me, you know?

MALE PROFESSOR

Well, that’s certainly an interesting topic, but you may not realize, I mean, the

scope…

FEMALE STUDENT

Well, especially now, ’cause I’ve got, like one roommate who’s from the South, and another one from New York, and we all talk, like, totally different, you know?

MALE PROFESSOR

Yes, I understand, but…

FEMALE STUDENT

But then I was noticing, like, we don’t really get into this till the end of the semester, you know? So I…

MALE PROFESSOR

So you want some pointers where to go for information on the subject? Well, you could always start by reading the chapter in the book on sociolinguistics; that would give you a basic understanding of the key issues involved here.

FEMALE STUDENT

Yeah, that’s what I thought! So I started reading the chapter, you know—about how everyone speaks some dialect of their language? And I’m wondering, like, well how do we even manage to understand each other at all?

MALE PROFESSOR

Ah! Yes, an interesting question. You see…

FEMALE STUDENT

So then I read the part about “dialect accommodation”—you know, the idea that people tend to adapt their speaking to make it closer to the speech of whoever they’re talking to. And I’m thinking, yeah, I do that when I talk with my roommates! 

And without even thinking about it or anything, you know?

MALE PROFESSOR

Okay, all right— “dialect accommodation” is a more manageable sort of topic…

FEMALE STUDENT

So I was thinking, like, I wonder just how much other people do the same thing? I mean, there’s students here from all over the place; does everyone change the way they talk to some degree, depending on who they’re talking to?

MALE PROFESSOR

You’d be surprised!

FEMALE STUDENT

So, anyway, my question is, do you think it’d be okay if I did a project like that for my term paper? You know, find students from different parts of the country, record them talking to each other in different combinations, report on how they accommodate their speech or not, that kind of thing?

MALE PROFESSOR

Tell you what, Lisa: Write me up a short proposal for this project—how you’re going to carry out the experiment and everything, a-a design plan—and I think this’ll work out just fine!
