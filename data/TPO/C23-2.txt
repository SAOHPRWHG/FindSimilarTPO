Hi, Bob. How’s it going? Are you enjoying the Introduction to Literature class?

MALE STUDENT

Yeah, it’s great! Uh, “Araby”—that short story by James Joyce we read last week—it was awesome.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Glad you liked it! Most of Joyce’s work is very complex. A lotta students say that he’s hard to understand. Normally, you wouldn’t tackle Joyce in an intro class. But I like to give my first-year students a taste of his style, his psychological approach to literature, because…well,mainly because it influenced others writers. I only wish we had more class time to discuss it.

MALE STUDENT

Me, too. So, why did you pick “Araby” instead of some other story?

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Well, um, first you should know that “Araby” is one of fifteen short stories by Joyce in a book called Dubliners… Uh, all the stories are related to one another and are set in the same time period. 



But “Araby” is the easiest one to follow…though all the stories in the collection are written in stream-of-consciousness, which, as you know, means they’re told through the narrator’s thoughts, through an inner monologue—as opposed to dialogue or an objective description of events. But “Araby” is easier because it’s linear; the story unfolds chronologically.

MALE STUDENT

Still, I wish we could read whole novels by Joyce and discuss them in class.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

That’s what happens in my Master Writer class.

MALE STUDENT

Master Writer class?

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Yeah, I teach one on Joyce every spring. It’s such a privilege [slight pause] spending an entire term delving into a single body of work. And my students, they bring so much insight to the table that it’s easy to forget who the professor is!

MALE STUDENT

Oh wow…uh, that could actually solve my dilemma, uh, what I originally wanted to ask you! Um,[upspeak] I’m working on my schedule for next term, and I’ve got room for one more course, and I’d like to take more Literature.[excited] Could I take your Master Writer class on Joyce?

FEMALE PROFESSOR

I’m sorry, I should’ve mentioned…um, Master Writer’s an advanced seminar. So students need to get a strong foundation in literary theory and criticism before I let them enroll.

MALE STUDENT

But I’ve gotten really good grades on all my papers so far; I’m sure I can keep up. Couldn’t you make an exception…?

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Your grades are excellent. But in our intro class, you’re reviewing the basics, like plot, setting, and character…and getting your first real exposure to different literary styles.

MALE STUDENT

But why do I have to study different styles to understand Joyce’s novels?

FEMALE PROFESSOR

[nicely trying to persuade him] There’re a lot of little details involved in interpreting literature. And, like with Joyce: his novels have very unique structures. The only way to appreciate how unique they are is by studying a variety of authors.

MALE STUDENT

Oh, OK. So,[pauses to regroup]could you suggest a different literature class, then?

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Sure—there’s Dr. Klein’s course on nineteenth-century novels. It’s more focused than the class you’re in now, but it’ll build on your current knowledge base and give you the background you need. That, plus a couple more foundational classes, and you’ll definitely be ready for my seminar.

MALE STUDENT

Sweet, thanks.
