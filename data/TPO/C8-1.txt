Hi, I’d like to drop off my graduation form. I understand you need this in order to process my diploma.

FEMALE REGISTRAR

OK, I’ll take that. Uh, before you leave, lemme check our computer… Uh, looks like you’re OK for graduation  and…hmmmm. Actually, I’m getting a warning flag on your academic record here.

MALE STUDENT

Really?

FEMALE REGISTRAR

Yeah, let’s see what’s what.  Uh, OK, are you familiar with our graduation requirements?

MALE STUDENT

Um, I think so.

FEMALE REGISTRAR

Then you know you need forty-eight credits in your major field to graduate, and at least twenty-four credits at the intermediate level or higher. Also, after your second year, you have to meet with your department chair to outline a plan for the rest of your time here. In the past, we also issued letters before a student’s final year began to let them know what they needed to take in their final year to be OK. But we don’t do that anymore…

MALE STUDENT

I-I definitely met with my chairperson two years ago. Uh, he told me that I needed eight more courses at the intermediate level or higher in the last two years to be OK…so I’m not sure what the problem is. I made sure I got those credits.

FEMALE REGISTRAR

Unfortunately, the computer’s usually pretty reliable… so I’m not sure what’s going on here.

MALE STUDENT

It could be that I’ve taken two basic courses but coupled both of them with field experiences.

FEMALE REGISTRAR

What do you mean?

MALE STUDENT

Well, I could only take intro courses because there were no intermediate-level courses available for those particular topics. My chairperson told me that if I did independent field research in addition to the assigned work in each course, they would count as intermediate-level courses. My classmates, um, well, some of my classmates did this for an easy way to meet the intermediate course requirement. But I did it to get the kind of depth in those topics I was going for. As it turned out, I really enjoyed the fieldwork. It was a nice supplement to just sitting and listening to lectures.

FEMALE REGISTRAR

I’m sure that’s true, but the computer’s still showing them as basic-level courses, despite the fieldwork.

MALE STUDENT

I’m not sure what to do, then. I mean, should I cancel my graduation party?

FEMALE REGISTRAR

No! No reason to get worried like that. Just contact your chairperson immediately, OK? Uh, tell him to call me as soon as possible so that we can verify your fieldwork arrangement and certify those credits right away. It’s not like there’s an actual deadline today or anything, but if more than a few weeks go by, we might have a real problem that would be very difficult to fix in time for you to graduate. In fact, there probably would be nothing we could do.

MALE STUDENT

I’ll get on that.
