Before we get started, I...I just wanted to say I’m glad you chose food science for your major course of study.

FEMALE STUDENT

Yeah, it seems like a great industry to get involved with. I mean, with a four-year degree in food science, I’ll always be able to find a job.

MALE PROFESSOR

You’re absolutely right. Eh, before entering academia, I worked as a scientist for several food manufacturers and for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. I even worked on a commercial fishing boat in Alaska a couple of summers while I was an undergraduate. We’d, we’d bring in the day’s catch to a floating processor boat, where the fish got cleaned, packaged, and frozen—right at sea.

FEMALE STUDENT

That’s amazing. As a matter of fact, I’m sort of interested in food packaging.

MALE PROFESSOR

Well, for that, you’ll need a strong background in physics, math, and chemistry.

FEMALE STUDENT

Those are my best subjects—for a long time I was leaning toward getting my degree in engineering.

MALE PROFESSOR

Well, then you shouldn’t have a, a problem. And fortunately, at this university, the Department of Food Science offers a program in food packaging. Elsewhere, you might have to hammer courses together on your own.

FEMALE STUDENT

I guess I lucked out, then! Um, so since my appointment today’s to discuss my, my term paper topic…I wanted to ask, could I write about food packaging? I realize we’re supposed to research food-borne bacteria, but food packaging must play a role in all of that, right?

MALE PROFESSOR

Absolutely. Maybe you should do some preliminary research on that…

FEMALE STUDENT

I have! That’s the problem.

I’m overwhelmed! 

MALE PROFESSOR

Well, in your reading, did anything interest you in particular, I, I mean something you’d like to investigate?

FEMALE STUDENT

Well, I was surprised about the different types of packaging used for milk. Y’know, clear plastic bottles, opaque bottles, cardboard containers…

MALE PROFESSOR

True! In fact, the type of packaging has something to do with the way milk’s treated against bacteria.

FEMALE STUDENT

Yeah, and I read a study that showed how light can give milk a funny flavor and decrease its nutritional value. And yet, most milk bottles are clear. What’s up with that?

MALE PROFESSOR

Well, consumers like being able to visually examine the color of the milk. That might be one reason that opaque bottles haven’t really caught on. But that study…I’m sure there’re more studies on the subject…uh, you shouldn’t base your paper on, on only one study.

FEMALE STUDENT

Maybe I should write about those opaque plastic bottles…find out if there’s any scientific reasons they aren’t used more widely. Maybe opaque bottles aren’t as good at keeping bacteria from growing in milk after the bottle’s been opened or something. But where to begin researching this, I don’t…

MALE PROFESSOR

Y’know, there’s a dairy not far from here, in Chelsea. It was one of the first dairies to bottle milk in opaque plastic, but now they’re using clear plastic again…And they’re always very supportive of the university and our students, so if you wanted…

FEMALE STUDENT

Hmm…Yeah, I like that idea.
