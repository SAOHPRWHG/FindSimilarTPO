FEMALE STUDENT

Hi, thanks for seeing me on such short notice.

MALE COUNSELOR

No problem. How can I help?

FEMALE STUDENT

Well, I think I might’ve made a mistake coming to this school.

MALE COUNSELOR

What makes you say that?

FEMALE STUDENT

I’m a little overwhelmed by the size of this place. I come from a small town. There were only 75 of us in my high school graduating class. Everyone knew everyone; we all grew up together.

MALE COUNSELOR

So it’s a bit of a culture shock for you, being one of 15,000 students on a big campus in an unfamiliar city.

FEMALE STUDENT

That’s an understatement. I just can’t get comfortable in class, or in the dorms, you w, socially.



MALE COUNSELOR

Hmm, well—let’s start with your academics. Tell me about your classes.

FEMALE STUDENT

I’m taking mostly introductory courses, and some are taught in these huge lecture halls.

MALE COUNSELOR

And you’re having trouble keeping pace with the material?

FEMALE STUDENT

No, in fact, I got an A on my first economics paper. It’s just that, it’s so impersonal. I’m not used to it.

MALE COUNSELOR

Are all your classes impersonal?

FEMALE STUDENT

Nah … It’s just that, for example, in sociology yesterday, the professor asked a question. So I raised my hand … several of us raised our hands … and I kept my hand up because I did the reading and knew the answer. But the professor just answered his own question and continued with the lecture.

MALE COUNSELOR

Well, in a big room, it’s possible he didn’t notice you. Maybe he was trying to save time. In either case, I wouldn’t take it personally.

FEMALE STUDENT

I suppose. But I just don’t know how to, you know, distinguish myself.

MALE COUNSELOR

Why not stop by his office during office hours?

FEMALE STUDENT

That wouldn’t seem right, y’know … taking time from other students who need help.

MALE COUNSELOR

Don’t say that. That’s what office hours are for. There’s no reason you couldn’t pop in to say hi, to, uh, to make yourself known. If you’re learning a lot in class, let the professor know. Wouldn’t you appreciate positive feedback if you were a professor?

FEMALE STUDENT

You’re right. That’s a good idea.

MALE COUNSELOR

OK, uh, let’s turn to your social life. How’s it going in the dorms?



FEMALE STUDENT

I don’t have much in common with my roommate or anyone else I’ve met so far. Everyone’s into sports, and I’m more artsy, you know, into music. I play the cello.

MALE COUNSELOR

Ahhh. Have you been playing long?

FEMALE STUDENT

Since age 10. It’s a big part of my life. At home, I was the youngest member of our community orchestra.

MALE COUNSELOR

You’re not going to believe this! There’s a string quartet on campus—all students. And it so happens the cellist graduated last year. They’ve been searching high and low for a replacement, someone with experience. Would you be interested in auditioning?

FEMALE STUDENT

Absolutely! I wanted to get my academic work settled before pursing my music here, but I think this would be a good thing for me. I guess if I really want to fit in here, I should find people who love music as much as I do. Thank you!

MALE COUNSELOR

My pleasure.
