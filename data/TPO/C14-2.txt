FEMALE ADVISOR

Hi, Steve. I scheduled this appointment ‘cause it’s been a while since we touched base.

MALE STUDENT

I know. I’ve been really busy. A friend of mine works on the school paper. He asked if I’d like to try reporting. So I did, and I really love it.

FEMALE ADVISOR

Hey, that sounds great.

MALE STUDENT

Yeah, the first article I wrote, it was a profile of the chemistry professor, the one who was named [upspeak] teacher of the year. My article ran on the front page. When I saw my name, I mean, my byline, in print, I was hooked. Now I know this is what I want to do—be a reporter.

FEMALE ADVISOR

Isn’t it great to discover something that you really enjoy? And I read that article, too. It was very good.

MALE STUDENT

To be honest, the article got lots of editing. In fact, I barely recognized a couple of paragraphs. But the editor explained why the changes were made. I learned a lot, and my second article didn’t need nearly as many changes.

FEMALE ADVISOR

Sounds like you’ve got a real knack for this.

MALE STUDENT

Yeah. Anyway, I’m glad you scheduled this meeting ‘cause I wanna change my major to journalism now.

FEMALE ADVISOR

Um. The university doesn’t offer a major in journalism.

MALE STUDENT

Oh no!

FEMALE ADVISOR

But—

MALE STUDENT

I-I mean…should I transfer to another school? Or major in English?

FEMALE ADVISOR

Well, wait a minute. Let me explain why the major isn’t offered. Editors at newspapers…editors…I mean, when you apply for a reporting job, editors look at two things: they wanna see clips, you know, some of your published articles. They’ll also want you to try out. They’ll give you an assignment, like um, covering a press conference or some other event, and then see if you can craft a story about it, accurately, on deadline.

MALE STUDENT

[taken aback] So they don’t even look at my major?

FEMALE ADVISOR

It’s not that they don’t look at it … it’s … well, having a degree in something other than journalism should actually work to your advantage.

MALE STUDENT

How?

FEMALE ADVISOR

Most journalists specialize these days. They only write about science, or business, or technology, for example. Is there a type of reporting you think you might like to specialize in?

MALE STUDENT

Well, I think it’d be really cool to cover the Supreme Court. I mean, their decisions affect so many people.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

That’s a goal worth striving for. So, why not continue majoring in political science? And, as electives, you could take some pre-law classes, like constitutional law. And as for your work on the student newspaper, maybe they’d let you cover some local court cases, ones that students and professors here would wanna read about.

MALE STUDENT

Do you know of any?

FEMALE ADVISOR

Well, I do, actually. There’s a case involving this computer software program that one of our professors wrote. The district court’s deciding if the university’s entitled to any of the professor’s profits.

MALE STUDENT

Wow. I’ll definitely follow up on that.
