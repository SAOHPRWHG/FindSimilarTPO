Excuse me, uh, I’m supposed to be having my physics class in the science building, but no one’s in the classroom… could you tell me where the class is? Physics 403? Has it been moved?

MALE RECEPTIONIST

Well, there’s a room assignment sheet on the bulletin board outside this office, …

FEMALE STUDENT

Yeah, I know, but my class isn’t listed there. There must be some kinda mistake or something. Could you look it up, please?

MALE RECEPTIONIST

M, okay, let me check on the computer. It’s physics, right? Wait, did you say Physics 403?

FEMALE STUDENT

Yeah.

MALE RECEPTIONIST

Well, I’m sorry but… it says here that it was canceled… You should’ve gotten a letter from the registrar’s office about this…

FEMALE STUDENT

What? I never got it.

MALE RECEPTIONIST

Are you sure? Cuz it says on the computer that the letter was sent out to students a week ago.

FEMALE STUDENT

Really? I shoulda gotten it by now…I wonder if I threw it away with all the junk mail by mistake…

MALE RECEPTIONIST

Well, it does happen.... Um, let me check something. What’s your name?

FEMALE STUDENT

Woodhouse. Laura Woodhouse.

MALE RECEPTIONIST

OK, ummm, Woodhouse…let me see..., ah, it says here we sent it to your apartment on… uh… Center Street.

FEMALE STUDENT

Oh, that’s my old apartment... I moved out of there a little while ago…

MALE RECEPTIONIST

Well… and I suppose you haven’t changed your mailing address at the administration office. Well, that would explain it.

FEMALE STUDENT

Yeah, I guess that’s it. But, how can they cancel a class after offering it? If I’d known this was gonna happen, I’d’ve taken it last semester.

MALE RECEPTIONIST

I know, it’s really inconvenient for you, I understand that, but un… if we don’t have enough students signed up for the course, the college can’t offer it, you know, it’s um, a practical issue, like, we can’t have an instructor when there’re only a few students in the class. You see what I mean?

FEMALE STUDENT

I guess , but now I don’t know what course I should take instead.

MALE RECEPTIONIST

Okay, let’s see… do you have any courses you were gonna take next semester? If you do, you might wanna take’em now and sign up for Physics 403 next semester.

FEMALE STUDENT

Yeah, I guess I could do that, I just hope it won’t be canceled again. Do you know how many people have to be enrolled in order to keep a class from being canceled?

MALE RECEPTIONIST

Well, it depends on the class, but for that class, you have to have… um… let’s see…usually it’d be at least ten people, but since it was canceled this semester, they might even do it with less. But you know what you should do? Give the physics department a call a coupla weeks before the semester starts. They’ll be able to tell you if they’re planning to go through with it... it’s their decision, actually.

FEMALE STUDENT

Oh, OK, I’ll do that. Thanks for the info.

MALE RECEPTIONIST

No problem. Sorry about the class…oh, why don’t you go change your mailing address now, it’ll only take a minute.

FEMALE STUDENT

Oh, oh, sure, I’ll do that right away.
