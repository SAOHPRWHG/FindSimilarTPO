MALE STUDENT

Excuse me. Can you help me with something?

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

I’ll do my best. What do you need?

MALE STUDENT

Well, I received a letter in my mailbox saying that I’m supposed to return a book that I checked out back in January— uh, it’s called Modern Social Problems— but because I’m writing my senior thesis, I’m supposed to be able to keep the book all semester.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

So you signed up for “Extended Borrowing Privileges?”

MALE STUDENT

Yeah.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

But we’re still asking you to bring the book back? 

MALE STUDENT

Uh huh.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

Well, let me take a look and see what the computer says. The title was Modern Social Problems?

MALE STUDENT

Yeah.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

Okay…Oh, I see. It’s been recalled. You can keep it all semester as long as no one else requests it. But someone else has… it looks like one of the professors in the sociology department has requested it, so you have to bring it back even though you’ve got “extended Borrowing Privileges.” You can check out the book again when it’s returned in a couple of weeks.

MALE STUDENT

But I really need this book right now.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

Do you need all of it, or is there a certain section or chapter you’re working with?

MALE STUDENT

I guess there’s one particular chapter I’ve been using lately for a section of my thesis. Why?

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

Well, you can photocopy up to one chapter of the book. Why don’t you do that for the chapter you’re working on right now—and by the time you need the rest of the book, maybe it’ll have been returned. We can even do the photocopying for you, because of the circumstances.

MALE STUDENT

Oh, well, that would be great.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

I see you’ve got some books there. Is that the one you were asked to return?

MALE STUDENT

Uh, no. I left it in my dorm room. These are books I need to check out today. Um, is it OK if I bring that one by in a couple of days?

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

Uh, actually, you need to return it today, that is, if you want to check out those books today. That’s our policy.

MALE STUDENT

Oh, I didn’t know that.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

Yeah, not a lot of people realize that. In fact, every semester we get a few students who’ve had their borrowing privileges suspended completely because they haven’t returned books. They’re allowed to use books only in the library; they’re not allowed to check anything out because of unreturned books. 

MALE STUDENT

That’s not good. I guess I should head back down to the dorm right now then.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

But before you go, what you should do is fill out a form requesting the book back in two weeks. You don’t want to waste any time getting it back.

MALE STUDENT

Thanks a lot! Now I don’t feel quite so bad about having to return the book.
