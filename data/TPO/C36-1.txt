FEMALE STUDENT

Hi, Professor Jones. Thanks for seeing me.

MALE PROFESSOR

No problem, Laura. How was your summer break?

FEMALE STUDENT

[Making a great pronouncement] It was great! But the fact is, it’s made me reconsider my academic plans.

MALE PROFESSOR

[Surprised] Oh really...? Nothing too dramatic, I hope.

FEMALE STUDENT

No, no, [A little sheepish] at least I hope not.

MALE PROFESSOR

[A little warily] What do you mean—exactly?

FEMALE STUDENT

Well, I just spent the summer working on a Native American reservation, a Navajo reservation, in Arizona. And I was fascinated... so, now I want to study the Navajo language, um, their history, religion...I want to go back next summer, too, and maybe even spend a semester there, some kind of internship or independent study.

MALE PROFESSOR

Wow, sounds like you’re really enthusiastic. But, you were majoring in sociology and I seem to recall that for your senior project you were doing something with education... 

FEMALE STUDENT

Right. I’ve done [Meaning “not too much”]some research on the public schools in the northeastern states... how they’ve been affected by changes in population... um... immigration trends—during the past 50 years. But now, I really want to study the culture of the Navajo people.

MALE PROFESSOR

[A little bit surprised but affable] Well, there are a couple of options . . . depending on your priorities.

[As if just thinking of it] Say, how’d you end up on a reservation in Arizona anyway?

FEMALE STUDENT

[Wanting to talk about it] Well, a friend of mine took a job there . . . [up speak] uh, in a summer-school program... and they had another opening—someone canceled at the last minute. I thought it would just be a big adventure. But it turned out to be much more than that.

MALE PROFESSOR

I see. [A short pause, considering what she said] Anyway, as I was saying, your options depend on what your priorities are... and on exactly what you want to study.

FEMALE STUDENT

[Unsure what he’s getting at] UH, like I said…Navajo culture.

MALE PROFESSOR

Let’s see if we can be more specific. If you want to study the Navajo language, learn about their religion, their history... that’s part of cultural anthropology.

FEMALE STUDENT

[Repulsed by the idea of changing her major] No, I really don’t want to change majors at this point. I love sociology, and I really want to graduate in four years.

MALE PROFESSOR

[Not critical; he’s glad she’s defined her priorities] OK, now I see what your priorities are. So, from a sociological perspective... since you’re interested in education, you can stay with that... change your research topic to the Native American experience with public education... the effect it’s had. And you could take sociology courses on religion or the role of minorities in society... again, focusing your research on the Navajo.

FEMALE STUDENT

Um, I hadn’t thought about that angle. Sounds intriguing. And all the courses I’ve already taken would still count toward my degree?

MALE PROFESSOR

I’d have to check, and we might need to plan carefully to make sure all your degree requirements are met, but I don’t see any problems.

FEMALE STUDENT

[Happy it’s all settled] Great. And then I can pick up the language and culture courses as electives.
