So, Professor Tibbits, your note said that you wanted to see me … about my Hemingway paper? I have to say, that grade wasn’t what I was expecting. I thought I’d done a pretty good job.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Oh, you did. But do you really want to settle for pretty good when you can do something very good?

MALE STUDENT

You think it can be very good?

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Absolutely.

MALE STUDENT

Would that mean you’d, I could get a better grade?

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Oh sorry, it’s not for your grade; it’s … I think you could learn a lot by revising it.

MALE STUDENT

You mean rewrite the whole thing? I’m really swamped; there’s deadlines wherever I turn, and … and I don’t really know how much time I could give it.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Well, it is a busy time … with spring break coming up next week. It’s your call, but I think that with a little extra effort you can really turn this into a fine essay.



MALE STUDENT

No, yeah, I mean, after I read your comments,I—I can see how it tries to do too much.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Yeah, it’s just too ambitious for the scope of the assignment.

MALE STUDENT

So I should cut out the historical part.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Yes, I would just stick to the topic, anything unrelated to the use of nature imagery has no place in the paper; all that tangential material just distracts from the main argument.

MALE STUDENT

I never know how much to include, you know, where to draw the line.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Tell me about it.  All writers struggle with that one. But it’s something you can learn, that’ll become more clear with practice. But I think if you just cut out the, uh

…

MALE STUDENT

The stuff about the history … but, if I cut out those sections, won’t it be too short?

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Well, better a short, well–structured paper than a long paper that’s poorly structured and wanders off topic.

MALE STUDENT

So, all I have to do is delete those sections?

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Well, not so fast. After you cut out those sections you’ll have to go back and revise the rest … to see how it all fits together. And of course, you’ll have to revise the introduction, too, to accurately describe what you do in the body of the paper. But that shouldn’t be too difficult; just remember to keep the discussion focused. Do you think you can get it to me by noon tomorrow?

MALE STUDENT

Wow… um, I have so much… uh but I’ll try.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

OK, good, do try. But if you can’t, we’ll shoot for after spring break, OK?
