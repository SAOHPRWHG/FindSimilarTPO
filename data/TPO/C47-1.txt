Ms. Harper?

FEMALE DIRECTOR

Yes, can I help you?

MALE STUDENT

Hi, my name’s Eric Patterson. I’m a journalism student. Uh, I wanted to ask you about the orchestra…

FEMALE DIRECTOR

I’m sorry Eric, but the orchestra is only open to music majors.

MALE STUDENT

Really? Well, see—

FEMALE DIRECTOR

But the policy’s changing next year. After that, if you’ve taken three music courses, you will be able to audition.

MALE STUDENT

Well, uh, I have taken some music courses, and I do play the double bass, so maybe that’s something to think about. But actually, I was here about something else.

FEMALE DIRECTOR

Oh, sorry! It’s just I-I get that question all the time, so…

MALE STUDENT

That’s OK. Thing is, I work for Magna—the school paper—and I’m reporting on last week’s concert. Now, I went to it, and I really enjoyed it, but now I’m looking for some background knowledge.

FEMALE DIRECTOR

Well, I can refer you to some of the students in the orchestra, if you’d like a young musician’s point of view…

MALE STUDENT

Uh, I-I guess that might be helpful… But um, I’m really looking for a little bit of scholarly perspective. Some history of the music that was performed that evening. Where it originated, how it’s developed over time…

FEMALE DIRECTOR

Well, some of our musicians kind of specialize in Appalachian music; in fact, that’s part of the reason we performed it. So you really should talk to them, too. Um, OK, so we were playing Appalachian music… from communities in the Appalachian mountain regions of the United States.

MALE STUDENT

All right…

FEMALE DIRECTOR

Uh… do you really think you can keep this all in your head?

MALE STUDENT

Oh. Don’t worry. All I need are a few key facts. I’m sure I can keep them straight until I get back to my dorm.

FEMALE DIRECTOR

So. The music is generally based on folk ballads and instrumental dance tunes. Um, it started with Scottish and Irish immigrants who brought over their styles of music. It’s called Anglo-Celtic.

MALE STUDENT

So, people brought their musical traditions with them.

FEMALE DIRECTOR

Well, this Anglo-Celtic music was considered an important link to the past for these people, which you can see in the way that Appalachian singers sing ballads; they have sort of a nasal quality to them, like in Celtic ballads. In their new land, some of the lyrics were updated, you know, to refer to the new locations, and the occupations that settlers had in America. But at the same time, lots of ballads were still about castles, and royalty… lords and ladies… stuff like that. Which is what they were about originally.

MALE STUDENT

OK, and was that some sort of banjo I saw onstage during the performance?

FEMALE DIRECTOR

Yes, we’re lucky that one of our students, Stewart Telford, has a nineteenth-century banjo—a real antique. He’s able to play in most of the traditional styles. Did you know that banjos are of African American origin, and that settlers in Appalachia adopted banjos for their folk music? They became very common in traditional Appalachian music, along with guitars and violins, of course…. But if you want to learn about that banjo, talk to Stewart.

MALE STUDENT

That’s great, Ms. Harper. Thanks a lot. Now, can you recommend any sources where I could look up more about this?

FEMALE DIRECTOR

Sure, I have a great book. A student has it today, but you can borrow it tomorrow if you’d like.
