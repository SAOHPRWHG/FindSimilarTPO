Hi, I’m Jim—the guy who’s trying to get a new show.

FEMALE PROGRAM MANAGER

Right. Jim.

MALE STUDENT

My application got turned down, and um, I’m not sure why. So I wonder if you could explain …

FEMALE PROGRAM MANAGER

Well, I’m glad you came in Jim…I was actually quite impressed with your application …

MALE STUDENT

[confused] OK …

FEMALE PROGRAM MANAGER

But the thing is, we run a music station here, not a talk station. We’ve been a music station since the beginning, since the station’s inception.

MALE STUDENT

This is where I get confused, because of the article in last month’s campus newspaper about the poll... 

FEMALE PROGRAM MANAGER

[musing thoughtfully] Yes, the survey.

MALE STUDENT

I mean, a majority of students said they felt the station was stale. That it needed a breath of fresh air. Well, um, how are you supposed to get fresh air if you keep all the windows and doors closed? I was just trying to open some windows for people … [laughs gently]

FEMALE PROGRAM MANAGER

I can tell you have a lot of passion for this, but I-I’m really not convinced it’s a good idea. OK, the first thing is, again, this is a music station. If we just have that one call-in show, it-it just doesn’t fit in with what we’re doing … and studies have shown that mixed-format stations just aren’t as successful as…look, we do want to innovate, but within the format. And with a live call-in show, for one thing, you have no idea what the caller is going to say…no idea what you could end up broadcasting.

MALE STUDENT

I understand, but that seems like a small risk to take in exchange for giving students a chance to talk publicly, interactively, about issues they care about. I really think they’d like to have a place where they can air their views about current events, about the university…

FEMALE PROGRAM MANAGER

But the university already has that—there’s a monthly meeting, open to all students, to discuss issues like the ones you mentioned in your application. And there are several student clubs on campus that discuss current events. But either way, we have no plans to change the format. Now, if you had an innovative idea for a new music program…

MALE STUDENT

Well…how about a music program that includes taking calls from listeners?

FEMALE PROGRAM MANAGER

You really are determined to have a call-in show, huh? [chuckles]

MALE STUDENT

Well, I’m a communications major, and I’m hoping to get an internship at a professional talk radio show in the city next year. I thought a little experience with the college station might help.

FEMALE PROGRAM MANAGER

I’ll tell you what. There’s still some time before the application deadline. Why don’t you submit a new application with the music show idea you just proposed. Then we’ll see if we can work something out.

MALE STUDENT

OK, thanks.
