MALE STUDENT

This is the administrative office, right?

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

Uh-huh. How can I help you?

MALE STUDENT

Well … I’m stopping by to reserve a place for my school club to meet and work. Pretty much on a regular basis. Ideally … our preference would be to have our own office.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

Hmmm … well, we are out of private offices … but we do have some semiprivate options still available.

MALE STUDENT

Whaddaya mean?

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

Well, it’s a setup where you’ll have a larger work space shared by two other clubs…. In other words, each club will have its own work area within that one room.

MALE STUDENT

Oh … are there any divider walls or anything?

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

Oh, yes, there will be a couple of dividers, so there is some privacy.

MALE STUDENT

Um … we’ll work with that then. I wouldn’t wanna be without an office!

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

OK, here are the two forms you have to fill out. Why don’t you do it now while I set that up through our computer system?

MALE STUDENT

OK.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

So … what’s your club’s name and the last name of the club president?

MALE STUDENT

Oh, it’s the photography club. And it’s Williams …. That’s me, John Williams.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

Mmm... That’s not pulling up anything on my screen. Um, let me try something else. Uh, how about your faculty adviser’s name?

MALE STUDENT

Sarah Baker. She’s in the arts department.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

Hmm... No … strange … y’know, your club’s just not showing up in my online records. Is this an established club?

MALE STUDENT

No, uh, actually, it’s a brand new one.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

Hmmm…. Have you completed the registration process?

MALE STUDENT

Yeah, last week. That was my very first step.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

Right, well, for my purposes, a club definitely has to be registered before I can proceed further. At the moment, however, it appears that there’s no record of your club’s registration. 

MALE STUDENT

Really? I thought everything was finalized last week.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

Well … it is surprising. Usually, there’s a 24-hour turnaround in our computer database. So … then … do you have the registration approval letter from the review committee? That’ll give me the verification I need.

MALE STUDENT

Oh yeah, I do. I mean … well, I don’t have it with me, but I-I , uh, can get it from my dorm room, bring it back with me, and submit it with those forms you need from me.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

Great, that’ll work. And … just so you’re aware, there’re lots of benefits to being registered.

MALE STUDENT

Oh, yeah…. I think the university will give us permission to set up a Web site, right? I wanna get students sharing their ideas on the Web site, you know, establish a photography blog.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

Yes, you’ll be able to do that, and, um actually, there’s more. You’ll be allowed the use of audio-visual equipment at no cost …. You’ll receive a club mailbox … and a club e-mail address ….Uh, you’ll be allowed to post your flyers and posters around the campus for publicity … and you could be eligible for funding for club events.

MALE STUDENT

Well, we’re definitely interested in hiring a professional speaker at one of our campus events at some point in the semester. And speakers almost always charge a fee. So … I’ll definitely follow up on that!
