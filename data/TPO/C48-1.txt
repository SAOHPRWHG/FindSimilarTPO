FEMALE EMPLOYEE

Hi, can I help you?

MALE STUDENT

I hope so. My name’s Mark Whitman, I’m--

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

Don’t I remember you from last year? You worked in uh…where was it, the art library?

MALE STUDENT

Yeah. You’re good. That was me. And I really enjoyed the work.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

Right. Yeah, your supervisor gave us some really great feedback at the end of the year.

“Oh, he’s so organized, always on time, helpful...”

MALE STUDENT

Really? Well, I’m glad. It was a good job.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

Well, we usually try to match students’ jobs with their academic interests...



MALE STUDENT

Yeah, I’m not exactly sure what career I’m headed for, but librarian is a possibility. It was a great experience to learn how it works and, and meet some people working in the field. But for this year...well, that’s what I wanted to ask about.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

Oh. How come you waited so long to come in? You know how fast campus jobs fill up. If you’d come in earlier, you could probably have gotten the library job again-- I mean, since you have the experience from last year, you don’t need the training and all... but it’s been filled now.

MALE STUDENT

Yeah, I know. But I’d planned to get a job working at a restaurant off-campus this year. I really need to make more money than I did last year, and working as a waiter, there’s always the tips. But…[shrugs] I’ve tried a ton of places and I haven’t found anything. [hesitant] I know it’s really late, but well, uh, I was wondering… if maybe there was some job that hadn’t been taken? Or maybe, umm, someone started a job and, ya know, had to drop it or something?

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

Well, I doubt you’ll find...

MALE STUDENT

Could you, could you possibly check? I know it’s a long shot but … My friend Suzanne, she takes photography classes in Harrison Hall. And, um, she sort of thought there might be an opening in the janitorial staff.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

Um, why does your friend, the photography student, think she has information about a janitorial staff opening? I’m pretty sure those jobs’re filled. In fact, I remember taking lots of applications for them. Let me double check it online…

MALE STUDENT

She said the whole studio arts building and especially the photo lab have been kind of, uh…sort of messy lately? I mean, she says there’s, uh, chemicals and stuff left out and, ya know, it’s like no one’s been cleaning up. But that could just be, ya know, students using the lab after hours or something. Like, after it’s been cleaned.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

Hmm…hang on. There’s…uh…there is um… an asterisk…uh, next to one of the job numbers here. There’s a note. Let’s see… Huh!… Your friend’s right. Seems like one of the student janitors quit a couple weeks ago for some reason…. Well, whatever. It looks like this is your lucky day.

MALE STUDENT

Wow! That is so great! So who’s the contact person?

FEMALE EMPLOYEE

Check with the janitorial office.

MALE STUDENT

Fine. Thanks so much.
