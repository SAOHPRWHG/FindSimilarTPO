FEMALE PROFESSOR

OK, let’s see, right … [reading] “Modern stagings of a Shakespearean classic.” Well like I told you last week I think that’s a great topic for your paper. [questioning] So the title’ll be something like …

MALE STUDENT

I’m not really sure. Probably something like “Twentieth-Century Stagings of A Midsummer  Night’s Dream.”

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Yes. I like that: straightforward and to the point. So how’s the research going?

MALE STUDENT

Well, that’s what I came to talk to you about. I was wondering if you happened to have a copy of the Peter Brook production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream in your video collection. I’ve been looking for it everywhere, and … I’m having a really hard time tracking it down.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

That’s because it doesn’t exist.

MALE STUDENT

Huh! You mean in your collection, or at all?

FEMALE PROFESSOR

I mean at all. That particular production was never filmed or recorded.

MALE STUDENT

Oh no. I had no idea. From what I’ve read, that production, like, it influenced every other production of the play that came after it so … I just assumed it had been filmed or videotaped.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Oh, it definitely was a landmark production, and … it’s not like it ran for just a week, but either it was never filmed, or if it was, the film has been lost. [small laugh] And it’s ironic because there’s even a film about the making of the production, but none of the production itself.

MALE STUDENT

 So now what do I do … if there’s no video … ?

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Well, think about it. This is the most important twentieth-century staging of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, right? 

MALE STUDENT

But how can I write about Brook’s interpretation of the play if I can’t see his production?

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Just because there’s no recording doesn’t mean you can’t figure out how it influenced other productions.

MALE STUDENT

[unsure, hesitant] I guess there’s enough material around. But it’ll be a challenge.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

True, but think about it: You’re writing about dramatic arts … the theater, and that’s the nature of theater isn’t it?

MALE STUDENT

You mean because it’s live, when the performance is finished …

FEMALE PROFESSOR

That’s it, unless it’s filmed, it’s gone! But that doesn’t mean we can’t study it. And of course some students in this class are writing about productions in the nineteenth century… [laugh] and there are no videos of those. You know, one of the challenges for people who study theater is to find ways of talking about something that’s really so transient, about something that in a sense, doesn’t exist.
