NARRATOR

Listen to a conversation between a student and his academic advisor. 

MALE STUDENT

Hi, sorry I’m late, Professor Blaine.

FEMALE ADVISOR

No problem, Jim. So you’ve got some questions about your senior thesis requirement?

MALE STUDENT

Yeah, I’ve got a couple of problems actually. So, the first thing is, you normally write it during the first half of the academic year, right? In your final year of studies?

FEMALE ADVISOR

Right.

MALE STUDENT

But I have my student teaching scheduled for that time—I wanna teach high school English after graduation. So I really need to give that my full attention, and I just worry that I won’t be able to if I’m writing my senior thesis at the same time. I mean, it’s supposed to be 35 to 50 pages. That’s a serious commitment.

FEMALE ADVISOR

You’re right, but it really isn’t a problem.

MALE STUDENT

Really?

FEMALE ADVISOR

No, a lot of English majors get teacher certification. So we have students like you do their senior thesis after their student teaching. It works out well, because many students want to use a unit they taught as the basis of their paper. So you’ll just enroll in a thesis seminar for the second semester.

MALE STUDENT

Well, that’s a big relief. But it brings us to my second problem. I’ve really focused my studies on Old and Middle English literature. I’m even thinking about doing a graduate degree with a concentration in that after I’ve taught for a while. So I was hoping to do my senior thesis on Chaucer, on The Canterbury Tales, because that would obviously be useful if I do go on. But …

FEMALE ADVISOR

Ahh, but Professor Johnson …

MALE STUDENT

Exactly, Professor Johnson is going to be taking a sabbatical to do research in France during the second half of the year. So, without him around, I’m, uh, not sure how I could do a senior thesis on The Canterbury Tales. I mean, the focus of his teaching and research is unique around here.

FEMALE ADVISOR

Yes, I understand. It would be difficult to do your paper without Professor Johnson around. Hmm. Would you allow me to try to sell you on an alternate plan?

MALE STUDENT

Well, you can try … but Chaucer’s sort of my hero, if you know what I mean.

FEMALE ADVISOR

Well, I’m teaching a course on the literature of the Renaissance in the first half of the year. It’ll meet late in the day, so it won’t interfere with your teaching. And I haven’t offered it in quite a while now, so I doubt you’ve ever studied that period on the college level.

MALE STUDENT

No, I haven’t.

FEMALE ADVISOR

If you’d be interested in taking the course, I’d be happy to give you supplemental readings. And I’d also be happy to be your advisor for your paper later on.

MALE STUDENT

Well I’ve never looked at that area before, but I’ve always had an interest in it, so that does have a certain appeal.

FEMALE ADVISOR

Well, if you do decide to go this route, I would make that decision soon, and I would use this summer productively. After all, this is not going to be like taking an intro course.
