Did you register already for your classes next semester?

MALE STUDENT

Yes, I did.

FEMALE STUDENT

What are you taking?

MALE STUDENT

Um, contemporary literature, English style, um, a teaching seminar, and I still have to do my student teaching. I’m gonna help teach a writing class at the junior high.

FEMALE STUDENT

That’s a heavy schedule!

MALE STUDENT

Yeah, it’ll be really busy, and I’m also taking a theory class. I’m gonna have to quit my job in a couple of weeks, ’cause it’ll be just too much.

FEMALE STUDENT

Where do you work at? 

MALE STUDENT

Buster’s Coffee Shop, but just till the end of the month. What are you doing next semester?

FEMALE STUDENT

Actually, a teaching seminar too. And I’ll have to start writing my thesis. You know, I’m also going for my master’s degree.

MALE STUDENT

So, you’re not writing any poetry, I imagine…

FEMALE STUDENT

No. I was actually thinking about revising some of my poems and sending them in to places for publication.

MALE STUDENT

Cool. You should. Um, did you hear about that new poetry club—the “Poetry Kitchen”?

FEMALE STUDENT

Yeah. No time.

MALE STUDENT

It’s fun. It’s Sunday night. You don’t do anything Sunday nights.

FEMALE STUDENT

I do homework Sunday nights.

MALE STUDENT

Well, it’s only from 7:00 to 9:00.

FEMALE STUDENT

Is it every Sunday?

MALE STUDENT

Last Sunday of every month. I don’t know about this month, ’cause it’s probably a little too close to, uh, Thanksgiving, so they might move it up. I don’t know what they’re gonna do, but it’s a good time. It’s fun—some really impressive readings.

FEMALE STUDENT

Who? From our class?

MALE STUDENT

Some people from our class are reading. A lot of them go, sometimes even the professor.

FEMALE STUDENT

Really? I don’t know if I’d want to read in front of her. 



MALE STUDENT

You wouldn’t have to read—you can just watch. I just watched the first time. But it’s a good environment to read in, I think anyway.

FEMALE STUDENT

I’d probably have to write something new, so maybe during the summer. I just can’t now.

MALE STUDENT

Yeah, it wouldn’t be the same just reading old stuff. Are you gonna do summer school?

FEMALE STUDENT

Definitely. Otherwise I’ll be short six credits: I have no choice.

MALE STUDENT

Yeah, me too. This is the second summer I’ll have to take classes. Gotta go now. My Shakespeare class starts in twenty minutes.
