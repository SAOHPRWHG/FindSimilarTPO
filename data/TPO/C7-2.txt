Hi. I’m new here… I, uh, couldn’t come to the student orientation—and I’m wondering if you can give me a few quick pointers about the library? I’d really appreciate it.

FEMALE LIBRARIAN

Sure. I’d be glad to. What’s your major area of study?

MALE STUDENT

Latin American literature.

FEMALE LIBRARIAN

OK. Well, over here’s the section where we have language, literature, and the arts, and if you go downstairs you’ll find the history section. Generally the students who concentrate in Latin American literature find themselves researching in the history section a lot.

MALE STUDENT

[agreeing] Uh-huh. You’re right. I’m a transfer student. I’ve already done a year at another university, so I know how the research can go—I’ve spent a lot of time in the history section. So how long can I borrow books for?

FEMALE LIBRARIAN

Our loan period is a month. Oh, I should also mention that we have an interlibrary loan service…[upspeak] if you need to get hold of a book that’s not in our library. There’s a truck that runs between our library and a few other public and university libraries in this area. It comes around three times a week. 

MALE STUDENT

He that’s great! At my last school, it could take a really long time to get the materials I needed, so when I had a project, I had to make a plan way in advance. This sounds much faster.[pause] Another thing I was wondering is… is there a place where I can bring my computer and hook it up?

FEMALE LIBRARIAN

Sure. There’s a whole area here on the main floor where you can bring a laptop and plug it in for power. But on top of that we also have a connection for the Internet at every seat.

MALE STUDENT

Nice! So I can do all the research I need to do right here in the library. I’ll have all the resources, all the books and information I need right here in one place!

FEMALE LIBRARIAN

[proudly]Yup, that’s the idea! … I’m sure you’ll need photocopiers, too. They’re down the hallway to your left. We have a system where you have to use a copycard, so you’ll need to buy a card from the front desk. You insert it into the machine and you’re ready to make copies.

MALE STUDENT

How much do you guys charge?

FEMALE LIBRARIAN

Seven cents a copy.

MALE STUDENT

[Approvingly] That’s not too bad. Thanks. Uh, where’s the collection of rare books?

FEMALE LIBRARIAN

Rare books are up on the second floor. They’re in a separate room where the temperature is controlled to preserve the old paper in them. You need to get special permission to access them, and then you’ll have to wear gloves to handle them, ‘cause the oils in our hands, you know, can destroy the paper, and gloves prevent that, so we have a basket of gloves in the room.

MALE STUDENT

OK, thanks… I suppose that’s all I need to know. [Gratefully] You’ve been very helpful, thanks.

FEMALE LIBRARIAN

Any time. Bye.

MALE STUDENT

Bye.
