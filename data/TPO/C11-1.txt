FEMALE STUDENT

Hi, I need to pick up a gym pass.

MALE EMPLOYEE

O.K., I’ll need your name, year, and University I.D.

FEMALE STUDENT

Here’s my I.D. card, and my name is Gina Kent and I’m first year.

MALE EMPLOYEE

O.K., Gina, I’ll type up a pass for you right away.

FEMALE STUDENT

Great. This is exciting. I can’t wait to get started.

MALE EMPLOYEE

Oh, this is a wonderful gym.

FEMALE STUDENT

That’s what everybody’s been saying. Everyone is talking about the new pool and the new indoor courts, but what I love is all the classes.

MALE EMPLOYEE

The classes?

FEMALE STUDENT

Yeah, like the swimming and tennis classes and everything. 

MALE EMPLOYEE

Oh yeah, but this pass doesn’t entitle you to those.

FEMALE STUDENT

It doesn’t?

MALE EMPLOYEE

No, the classes fall into a separate category.

FEMALE STUDENT

[upset, confused] But that’s my whole reason for getting a pass. I mean I was planning to take a swimming class.

MALE EMPLOYEE

But that’s not how it works. This pass gives you access to the gym and to all the equipment, and to the pool and so forth, but not when the teams are practicing, so you’d have to check the schedule... 

FEMALE STUDENT

But what do I have to do if I want to take a class?

MALE EMPLOYEE

You’ll have to one, register, and two, pay the fee for the class.

FEMALE STUDENT

But that’s not fair.

MALE EMPLOYEE

Well, I think if you think about it you’ll see that it’s fair.

FEMALE STUDENT

But people who play sports in the gym … they don’t have to pay anything.

MALE EMPLOYEE

Yes, but they just come in and play or swim on their own. But taking a class, that’s a different story.  I mean someone has to pay the instructors.

FEMALE STUDENT

So… if I want to enroll in a class …

MALE EMPLOYEE

Then you have to pay extra. The fee isn’t very high, but there is a fee. So, what class did you say you wanted to take?

FEMALE STUDENT

Swimming.

MALE EMPLOYEE

O.K., swimming classes are $30 a semester.

FEMALE STUDENT

I guess I could swing that, but I’m still not convinced it’s fair. So, do I pay you?

MALE EMPLOYEE

Well, first you need to talk to the instructor. They have to assess your level and steer you to the right class—you know, beginner, intermediate ...

FEMALE STUDENT

You mean, I have to swim for them, show them what I can do?

MALE EMPLOYEE

No, no, you just tell them a little bit about your experience and skills, so they know what level you should be in.

FEMALE STUDENT

Oh O.K., so, I guess I’ll need an appointment.

MALE EMPLOYEE

And I can make that for you right now. And then I’ll type up your gym I.D. card, you’ll need it to get into the building. Now, about that appointment, um, how does Wednesday at 3 sound?

FEMALE STUDENT

Fine.

MALE EMPLOYEE

O.K., and you’ll be meeting with Mark Giddis, he’s the swimming instructor. He also coaches the swim team. And, here … I’ve jotted it all down for you.

FEMALE STUDENT

Great. Thanks.
