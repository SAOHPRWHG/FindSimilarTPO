MALE STUDENT

Hi, I hope you can help me. I just transferred from Northeastern State University, near Chicago …

FEMALE ADMINISTRATOR

Well, welcome to Central University. But Chicago’s such a great city, why did you leave?

MALE STUDENT

Everyone asks that…it’s my hometown, and it was sure convenient to go to a school near by. But Northeastern is still fairly small, and it doesn’t have the program I’m interested in…I want to major in international studies and the only program in the state is here.

FEMALE ADMINISTRATOR

We do have a great program. How did you get interested in international studies?

MALE STUDENT

My family hosted a few foreign-exchange students while I was growing up…then I took part in an international summer program after I graduated from high school. I found I really like meeting people from all over, getting to know them…

FEMALE ADMINISTRATOR

Oh, OK. And that led you to our program. Right now, though, I assume you’re looking for a job.

MALE STUDENT

Yeah, a part-time job on campus…I thought I’d save money, being away from the big city…but it doesn’t seem to be working that way. Anyway, I’m not having much luck.

FEMALE ADMINISTRATOR

I’m not surprised. Most of our campus jobs are taken in the first week or two of the semester. What work experience have you had?

MALE STUDENT

Well, I worked in the university library last year. But I already checked at the library here…they said their remaining positions were for work-study students getting financial aid. I’ve never run into that before.

FEMALE ADMINISTRATOR

Well, I guess each school has its own policies. We really don’t have much right now. You might be better off waiting until next semester … if you really want something …  How are your computer skills?

MALE STUDENT

About average, I’d say. I helped teach some of the basic computer classes Northeastern offers for new users, if that helps any.

FEMALE ADMINISTRATOR

OK…Uh, the technology support department needs people to work at its helpdesk. It’s basically a customer-service job…answering questions, helping people solve their computer problems…give you a chance to develop your people skills.

MALE STUDENT

Something every diplomat needs. But, is there some problem? I mean, why’s the job still open?

FEMALE ADMINISTRATOR

Well, they have extended hours … from 6 A.M. to 2 A.M. every day, so they need a large staff. But right now they only need people early mornings, late nights, and weekends. You’d probably end up with a bit of everything rather than a regular spot. On the bright side, you’d probably be able to get some studying done between calls. At least it’d be a start and then you can try for better hours next semester.

MALE STUDENT

Hmm, I see where the hours might be a problem. But…I guess I can’t afford to be too picky if I want a job. Still, maybe we can work something out.
