MALE STUDENT

Uh, hi, I need to get into Special Collections. In particular the British Literature. I was working with some of the William Blake books.

FEMALE LIBRARIAN

Well, then you must know that access is restricted.

MALE STUDENT

Um, I was in a seminar with Professor Gray, and she authorized access for us.

FEMALE LIBRARIAN

Oh, if that’s the case… let me check. Right, yeah, but it looks like that expired at the end of last semester.

MALE STUDENT

But I really need to get back in there. See, I didn’t quite finish my project…

FEMALE LIBRARIAN

Ah ha, the plot thickens! Well, it’s easy enough; have Professor Gray authorize you again. You see, these editions are rare and shouldn’t be handled more than necessary. Can you work from later editions? Or microfilm?

MALE STUDENT

Not really… actually my project—well, it involves some annotations in the particular edition here. They haven’t been reproduced because they’re really not part of the text. generally clean them up. They’re quite hard to see…



FEMALE LIBRARIAN

Well, often the characteristics of the manuscripts have been recorded. These types of extraneous markings might also be noted.

MALE STUDENT

I don’t think they are. They’re very faint, and well, I think I have a new angle on them. There was a study once a long time ago about these notes that everybody else has since taken for granted, without checking for themselves. I think there might have been a mistake in the past, that they were misread…

FEMALE LIBRARIAN

So, get Professor Gray…

MALE STUDENT

Uh, she’s away this semester. I had to beg her to give me extra time on this project. I haven’t even received a grade in the class yet. And, this class is a prerequisite for other classes in my major. I really need to see those books so I can finish up this project and get back on course to graduate on time.

FEMALE LIBRARIAN

Everybody has special circumstances…  

MALE STUDENT

Two hours? One hour? I promise to be careful. I just need to look at a few pages with a strong magnifying glass.

FEMALE LIBRARIAN

Well, I can’t let you in without authorization from your professor. Can you get in touch with her somehow?

MALE STUDENT

Maybe she’s checking her e-mail. I really thought I’d be able to straighten this out without her. You know, she did me a huge favor by giving me the extra time. I feel like I’m skating on thin ice with her…

FEMALE LIBRARIAN

You know, you were lucky to have had permission to look at the books last semester. If we don’t maintain our policies, they’ll disintegrate.

MALE STUDENT

I know. Would an e-mail from her or a phone call be good enough?

FEMALE LIBRARIAN

Of course.
