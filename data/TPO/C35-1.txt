FEMALE STUDENT

Hi, I’m Tina Morley. 

MALE COUNSELOR

Oh, Tina. Yeah, good to meet you. You told me on the phone that you’re looking for a part-time position?

FEMALE STUDENT

Yeah. My roommate works at the dining hall and she heard a part-time job might be opening up there for this new semester, so I was hoping …

MALE COUNSELOR

There was one … but that got filled a couple days ago.

FEMALE STUDENT

Oh no, really? Thing is … I’ve gotta do something to pay for expenses. And, well … I-I’m not afraid of hard work.

MALE COUNSELOR

I guess not! Y’see, I always have to check the class schedules of potential applicants … to make sure they’re full-time students in good standing. And … your schedule this past semester … I mean, everything from computer science to African history to zoology and physics … How do you manage with such a heavy class load?

FEMALE STUDENT

Pretty well, actually. If I do get a job, of course, I may have to cut back to a more normal schedule, but… y’know, there are so many great subjects to learn about.

MALE COUNSELOR

Ah, a generalist.

FEMALE STUDENT

Yeah. It’s gonna be hard for me to pick just one thing to specialize in.

MALE COUNSELOR

Say, that gives me an idea. Uh, you’re pretty comfortable on a computer, right? ... with learning new software applications?

FEMALE STUDENT

Sure, I’m pretty good at that. Why?

MALE COUNSELOR

Well, last week I got a call from the folks over at the Visualization Project. They want to add a couple part-timers to their staff.

FEMALE STUDENT

The Visualization Project?

MALE COUNSELOR

Yes. They help professors from all different departments turn information into something their students can see. You know, instead of just writing on a blackboard, more and more professors want to project information onto a screen. And … how do I say this … some professors are really good in their own subject areas, but when it comes to computers, well …

FEMALE STUDENT

I get the picture. So they use the Visualization Project to create … what … like, graphs of different sorts?

MALE COUNSELOR

Right. Graphs of economic trends, for instance, or population growth. And sometimes dynamic maps—maps that change on screen to show, for instance, how trade ebbed and flowed over the centuries along various routes between China and the Mediterranean.

FEMALE STUDENT

Wow, that’d be interesting.

MALE COUNSELOR

Yeah, and that’s just what they do for classroom lectures… A project staffer might also be asked to help professors pull together some of their research data and model that visually. They claim that putting their data in a map, for example, or a moving image, helps them see connections … new relationships in data on, say, animal migration patterns that they might miss if they’re just looking at numbers on a piece of paper …

FEMALE STUDENT

That’s terrific. Uh, what about working hours?

MALE COUNSELOR

They’re pretty flexible. Staffers can go in to work day or night … They just hafta make sure it’s all done by the time the professor needs it. So, shall I give you the number to call to get in touch with these people?

FEMALE STUDENT

Oh, would you? To think I came in just hoping to get something in the dining hall!
