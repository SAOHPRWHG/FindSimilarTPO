FEMALE HEAD OF MAINTENANCE

Can I help you?

MALE STUDENT

Yeah, I, uh—I’m taking summer classes right now, and they’ve put me in Roberts dormitory, over by the library…

FEMALE HEAD OF MAINTENANCE

OK…?

MALE STUDENT

And I guess they’re, uh…painting the library, or doing something to the outside of the building…

FEMALE HEAD OF MAINTENANCE

Ah, yes, they are—they’re replacing the bricks on the outside walls.

MALE STUDENT

Well, whatever it is, it’s, like, really disturbing for those of us with windows facing the library—they’re working on the wall right opposite us. I mean, dust is everywhere, coming in the windows...and the noise… ’Cause we’re like, what, ten feet away, and, uh—well, it’s just not a pretty picture. 



FEMALE HEAD OF MAINTENANCE

Right, well that’s why we waited until now to start work on it. I mean, most students have already left campus for summer vacation…

MALE STUDENT

Yeah, but Roberts Hall is being used by all the summer students.

FEMALE HEAD OF MAINTENANCE

Really? Housing didn’t notify us of that.

MALE STUDENT

Yeah, it’s pretty full! I mean, I can’t sleep at night ’cause of the smell, and the dust, and…you know, I’d love to just, like, close the windows, but you know, being summer and all…

FEMALE HEAD OF MAINTENANCE

Yes, I know, there’s no air-conditioning in that building…

MALE STUDENT

Right. So, I mean—we’ve got five more weeks of classes left, and we were really wondering how much longer they’re going to be working on that particular wall… ’Cause maybe, if it’s going to be a while, do you think they could maybe work on a different side of the building for now? One that’s not facing people’s dorm rooms? And wait till the students are gone to come back and finish this side? I mean, that way the dust and noise won’t be coming directly into our windows, while we’re here.

FEMALE HEAD OF MAINTENANCE

You know, I wish it weren’t being done this way. It doesn’t make sense. But this particular decision was made by a special committee, and their plan was finalized several months ago. Uh, they just didn’t realize there’d be students in Roberts Hall now.

MALE STUDENT

Yeah.

FEMALE HEAD OF MAINTENANCE

Plus, uh…well, the equipment is all set up, y’know, the scaffolding up on that side of the building—well, it just wouldn’t be practical to have the construction workers move everything to another side, and leave a whole side of the library all torn up like that.

MALE STUDENT

I guess not… Isn’t there another dorm open? Anywhere?



FEMALE HEAD OF MAINTENANCE

Not that I know—oh, wait! I overheard someone saying today that Manchester Hall isn’t being used by the City Summer Camp after all. Y’know, most years they house their participants in that dorm all summer.

MALE STUDENT

Well, there’s an idea…

FEMALE HEAD OF MAINTENANCE

Now it’s a smaller dorm, and it’s a little out of the way, but, uh…I-I bet they could move the affected students from Roberts Hall.

MALE STUDENT

Well, I think a lot of people would definitely appreciate that.

FEMALE HEAD OF MAINTENANCE

OK, well…well let me call the housing people, and then I’ll get back to you. Leave me your name and number, OK? I’ll let you know what I find out.

MALE STUDENT

Great! Thanks.
