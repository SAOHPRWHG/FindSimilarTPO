Hi, professor, I was hoping to ask you a few questions about the class you’re teaching next semester, the course on Polish Drama? [upspeak] I was thinking of taking it.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Well, that’s an upper-division course … You don’t look familiar to me. Are you a student in this department?

MALE STUDENT

No, actually, I’m not.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

OK. Have you had other classes in the Slavic Languages Department—here or somewhere else?

MALE STUDENT

No, that’s the thing…I was just wondering how good my Polish would have to be, whether the class is taught in Polish or not.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Well, you’d have to have some knowledge of it. By that level a lot of the students are quite fluent, plus there’re some native speakers in the department. And we don’t plan for it to happen, but it’s pretty common for the discussions to kind of move in and out of English and Polish, and it can be difficult to follow, so … uh, how well do you speak Polish?

MALE STUDENT

Not so great. It’s just that my father’s from there, so I’m interested in learning about, you know, Polish history, Polish culture. Plus, I’m studying drama—I’ll probably major in it—I love plays. So I thought your course might be perfect.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Hmm, to be honest with you … you have to realize that we’ll be watching videos of performances and maybe—if we can swing it—even watch a live performance, and those won’t necessarily be in translation … Also, texts—texts are sometimes available in translation, but even then some references will be to the original. I’d hope you’d be fairly confident in reading.

MALE STUDENT

To be honest, it sounds totally over my head.

FEMALE PROFESSOR

You know what? I believe they’ll be offering a survey course… on Polish literature … Let me check here … Yes, I thought it was being offered this time. Professor Jaworski’s teaching it… Let’s see… It covers the major works—you know, epic romantic poetry, the novels… And it does cover one or two plays.

MALE STUDENT

And this is in English?

FEMALE PROFESSOR

Yes, you’ll be reading mostly English translations, and the discussions will be in English.

MALE STUDENT

Hmmm. Novels and poetry…

FEMALE PROFESSOR

They’ll provide you with a great historical context for the plays, so when you do get to them, you’re going to really have a feel for the times they “lived” in, so to speak. Plus, this course might also give you the impetus to learn more Polish, you know, get it to the level where you’d be ready for the other class.

MALE STUDENT

Hmmm …
