Hi, Miss Hendricks.

FEMALE SECRETARY

Hi Brad. How are you?

MALE STUDENT

I’m fine except I have a question about my paycheck.

FEMALE SECRETARY

Sure, what’s up?

MALE STUDENT

Well, it’s already been several weeks into the semester, and my paycheck was supposed to go directly into my bank account, but there haven’t been any deposits.

FEMALE SECRETARY

That’s odd.

MALE STUDENT

Yeah, I thought graduate teaching assistants were automatically put on the payroll at the beginning of the semester.

FEMALE SECRETARY

They are... let’s see... did you complete all the forms for payroll?

MALE STUDENT

I filled in whatever they sent me, and... I returned it like, at the end of August.



FEMALE SECRETARY

Hmm. Well you definitely should’ve been paid by now. At least two pay periods have passed since then.

MALE STUDENT

I asked at the bank, and they didn’t know anything. Who should I talk to about this? Payroll?

FEMALE SECRETARY

I’m gonna contact them for you. There was a problem in processing some of the graduate student payroll paperwork, ‘cause their computer program crashed after all the information was processed, and some people’s information couldn’t be retrieved.

MALE STUDENT

Oh... but... why didn’t anyone let me know?

FEMALE SECRETARY

I don’t know how they work over there, cuz they couldn’t even figure out whose information was missing. And this isn’t the first time: Seems like something like this happens every semester.

MALE STUDENT

So... how do I find out if my information was lost?

FEMALE SECRETARY

I’ll contact them tomorrow morning to see if you’re in the system, but you’re probably not.

MALE STUDENT

Well then what’ll I need to do?

FEMALE SECRETARY

Sorry, but you’ll need to fill out all those forms again, and then I’ll fax them over to the payroll office.

MALE STUDENT

And then what? ...well... what I really need to know is... how long till I get some money? I’m already a month behind in my bills, and my tuition’s due soon.

FEMALE SECRETARY

They’ll get you into the system the same day they receive your paperwork, so if you do that tomorrow, you’ll get paid next Friday.

MALE STUDENT

That’s a long time from now. Will that paycheck include all the money I’m owed?



FEMALE SECRETARY

It should. I’ll double-check with the payroll department.

MALE STUDENT

And another thing: Is there any way I could get paid sooner? I have been teaching all these weeks...

FEMALE SECRETARY

I know it’s not fair but... I don’t think they can do anything. All the checks are computed automatically in the system. They can’t just... write checks.

MALE STUDENT

But... they’re the ones that made a mistake... and... they never told me.

FEMALE SECRETARY

I understand how you feel. If I were you, I’d be upset too …I’ll tell you what. When I call them, I’ll explain the situation and ask if there’s any way you could be paid sooner. But I have tell you that, based on past experience, you shouldn’t count on it.

MALE STUDENT

I understand. Thanks. I know it’s not your fault, and that you’re doing everything you can.

FEMALE SECRETARY

Well, what I can do is make sure that your first check is for the total amount that the university owes you.

MALE STUDENT

That’d be great. Thank you. I’ll be on campus about ten tomorrow morning, and I’ll come by to see you then.
