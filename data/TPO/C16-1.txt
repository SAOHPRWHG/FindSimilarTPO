FEMALE STUDENT

Hi, I’m Melanie. The one who’s been calling…

FACILITIES MANAGER

From the singing group, right?

FEMALE STUDENT

From the choir.

FACILITIES MANAGER

Right… the choir. It’s nice to finally meet you in person. So, you’re having problems with…

FEMALE STUDENT

Noise. Like I explained on the phone, we’ve always had our rehearsals in the Lincoln Auditorium—every day at three o’clock—and it’s always worked just great. But the past few weeks with the noise it’s been a total nightmare. Since construction started next door on the science hall…

FACILITIES MANAGER

Oh that’s right, they’re building that addition for new laboratories.

FEMALE STUDENT

Exactly. Anyway, ever since they started working on it, it’s been so noisy we can barely hear ourselves think.

FACILITIES MANAGER

Let alone sing.

FEMALE STUDENT

Forget about singing! I mean we keep the windows down and everything, but once those bulldozers get going, I mean those machines are loud! We’ve already had to cut short two rehearsals, and we’ve got a concert in six weeks.

FACILITIES MANAGER

Well, that’s not good. I’m assuming you’ve tried to reschedule your rehearsals? They don’t do construction work at night.

FEMALE STUDENT

I ran that by the group, but there were just too many... I mean evenings are really hard. It seems like everyone in the choir already has plans and some even have classes at night.

FACILITIES MANAGER

And what about the music building?

FEMALE STUDENT

Y’know, originally, we were booked in one of the rehearsal rooms in the music building but then we switched with the jazz ensemble. They’re a much smaller group—and they said the acoustics, the sound in that room was better for them—so having us move to a bigger space like the Lincoln Auditorium seemed like a reasonable idea.

FACILITIES MANAGER

But now…

FEMALE STUDENT

All that noise… I don’t know. I just wonder if the jazz ensemble knew what was going to happen…

FACILITIES MANAGER

Well that wouldn’t be very nice.

FEMALE STUDENT

No. But it really was quite a coincidence… Anyway, now the music building’s fully booked. Mornings, afternoons, everything. We just need a quiet space—and it has to have a piano.

FACILITIES MANAGER

A piano… of course, some of the other auditoriums have pianos, but that’s not going to be easy.

FEMALE STUDENT

You think they’re pretty booked up?

FACILITIES MANAGER

Probably, but it can’t hurt to check. Or what about Bradford Hall? I remember a piano in the old student center there.

FEMALE STUDENT

At this point, we’d be grateful for any quiet place.

FACILITIES MANAGER

 Can you… how flexible can you be on times? You said no evenings but what if I can’t find something open at three o’clock. Can you move earlier or later?

FEMALE STUDENT

I wish I could say another time would be OK but… you know how it is… everybody’s already got commitments… for the whole semester. 2:30 or 3:30 would probably be OK but I don’t think we could go much outside that…

FACILITIES MANAGER

Well, check with me tomorrow morning. I should have found something by then.

It might not be ideal…

FEMALE STUDENT

As long as it’s got a piano and nobody’s putting up a building next door, we’ll be happy.
